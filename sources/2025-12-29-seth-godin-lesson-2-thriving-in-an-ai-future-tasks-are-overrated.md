So where I begin is this change is certain.

The world is crazy.

It is upside down.

And this as is normal as it is ever going to be again.

And if your posture is to fight the change in every way you can, you will be frustrated and the change

isn't going to stop.

Yes, I agree.

It's easy to look at the world and say, wait a minute.

Amazon now has more robots in their warehouses than people.

More than a million robots work for Amazon.

And if you're a warehouse worker who is used to being told what to do, whose goal is step by step to

follow the instructions, this is not a good thing for you.

And.

That's.

Okay.

It's easy to say, oh, I plus robots is going to replace all of us.

and I'm just not buying it.

I think what is going to happen is the same thing that happened when electronic switchboards replaced

the more than 1 million people, most of them underpaid women who were there manually connecting every

phone call that was made in the United States.

That is the same thing happened when the steam shovel came along the ditch diggers.

They had a problem with the steam shovel because the steam shovel, in one fell swoop, replaced an

enormous number of people who stood in the hot sun digging ditches, that we can make a long list of

how technology has replaced huge swaths of our economy.

And yet, somehow, miraculously, it always invents more jobs, not fewer.

I am not saying there's a promise that everything is going to be perfect.

It's not.

I am not saying that your job is going to stay the same.

In fact, I'm certain it is not.

It is inconceivable to me that a real estate broker, a truck driver, a pharmacist, a daycare worker,

you name the job.

It is inconceivable to me, unless perhaps you're a massage therapist, that your job isn't going to

be dramatically and significantly altered in the next five years, given that, that is a certainty.

The question is, what should we do about it?

Not how do we make it go away?

How do we stall long enough that we can somehow get to the end of our career before it comes from us,

but instead shift away from our mindset, the mindset we learned as little kids of, will this be on

the test?

How do I get an A?

Show me the manual to here's this playground that they've invested $1 trillion of their money in, and

I get to play with it for free or for just a few bucks.

What will I do with it?

How will I become the best, the smartest, and most innovative in my little segment because like the

shoemaker with the elves, if you leave your shoes out, the elves are going to come at night and do

things with you and for you.

And we have to choose to embrace this, or we're going to get left behind and we're going to be frustrated

along the way.

So the next thing that begins this journey is a simple sentence.

Tasks are overrated.

Do you have a job where you do tasks?

Not where you decide what other people are going to do, but where there is an inbox and an outbox,

where you are filling out forms or going through a rubric or task after task after task.

Because the thing is, I is task oriented.

If we can write down all the steps you need to do to do your work, we can probably get an AI to do

it faster, cheaper and ultimately more reliable than you.

I have a good friend who's a great veterinary radiologist.

You probably never even thought there was such a thing.

Turns out every day millions of X-rays are taken of millions of dogs and cats.

Somebody needs to read those X-rays.

Some of those X-rays get read by the local vet.

But thanks to the internet, that vet can take the digital x ray, send it to an expert who never sees

a dog or cat all day long, and is looking at these x rays and can give an informed, insightful diagnosis

and send it back for not a lot of money.

Wait a minute.

It turns out, and I did this just a couple days ago.

In less than five minutes, you can build an artifact in anthropic in Claude that can read an x ray

almost as well as a mediocre X-ray technician and radiologist can for dogs and cats.

If it can do a mediocre job after five minutes in 2025, what's it going to be able to do when some

smart people work on it for a couple months next year.

What does this mean?

It means that if you have a task which is looking at inbound x rays, comparing them to a database and

making a diagnosis, you're not going to be able to do that for much longer.

There are other things that we need you to do where your expertise is going to be insanely valuable.

But this task orientation, if you're a real estate broker, if you're a truck driver, if you're a

radiologist, this task orientation of tell me the steps, it's getting in the way.

The internet sort of offered us the same opportunity when most people who work for a living saw the

internet.

What they saw was something that was either going to give them more tasks to do, or make the tasks

they did a little bit more efficient and a little bit faster.

But the winners have all been people who said, how do I use this new technology to solve a different

problem?
