Hey, Seth, thank you for that incredible introduction to AI and the Udemy course that you're working

on.

You hit three key points to me mindset, creating value with what we do and understanding versus tactics.

And that's huge.

When you talk about spending time working with the tools, the LMS, the AI platforms.

And do a lot of personal development work.

And the biggest challenge is getting people to take the initiative to make that switch to the areas

that you've hit on here.

How do you get folks to make the shift?

How do you reach them?

And I know one of my favorite themes from you is doing work for people that care.

It's really hard to get people to care about making that shift and really investing in themselves.

So I'd be curious how how to move that needle.

Thanks, Bill.

This is a great place to start.

As you know from working with me and following my work for a long time, we become what we do.

We don't do what we become.

So the way to change your attitude is to do the thing that many people confronted by this really rapid

rise in.

I are a little panicked and they're trying to make it go away and they're ignoring it, and they're

hoping that their career will be over before I ends their career.

This is a mistake.

I am a practical optimist, and what I mean by that is there are plenty of changes in the world that

if it were up to me, I might not vote for.

There are things happening in our environment, in our climate, and plenty of other places technologically

that we might not personally want that we don't think are going to end up well.

What a practical optimist does is they say, okay, but this is happening.

What is a positive way to think about this and put it to work?

Because it's better than having a negative expectation for what's going to happen.

Sure.

Make sure you have resilience.

Make sure you've lowered your cost of living.

Make sure that you've made it so that you can dance with all the changes around us.

I'm not being a Pollyanna here and saying everything is going to be better.

The dislocations are going to be significant.

But the practical optimist says, hmm, what can I do with that?

And that's the purpose of this short rant.

And course is it's free.

No one's going to see you fail.

It's not that horrible to try.

Give it a shot.

And if we can build the practice of using a tool, using a tool, using a tool, seeing how it works

and doing it again, it's inevitable that our attitude is going to change.

That almost no toddler enjoys learning how to walk.

It's only after they've put in the time and they see themselves as a walker that they wouldn't have

it any other way.

So that's my approach.

With all of these technologies, it's always going to be uncomfortable at first.

It's always going to feel like a suit that doesn't fit.

That's okay.

Put it on and try again.

And that leads us to Mandell Conway's question.

Okay.

So let's get specific.

It's July 2025.

What are two things that you can do today and tomorrow and the next day, just for a week for 30 minutes

a day.

Here we go.

Go to Midjourney.

Com set up a free account using Midjourney.

First go to their gallery and look at some of the videos that people are building.

Click on one of those videos and you will see how they built it.

It's astonishingly straightforward.

Okay, go build the video two seconds long.

Make it longer.

Now it's a five second long video.

Your assignment over the next week is to piece together a one minute long video.

Remember, none of this is going to cost you any money.

One minute long.

Upload it to YouTube.

Make a video that is worth watching using this tool.

Second project, go to Claude II and say to Claude, I am here to build an artifact.

Please teach me what I need to know and let it teach you.

Go look at some of the artifacts.

You can find them by googling or perplexing, uh, Claude artifacts.

Anthropic artifacts.

Okay, now go build an artifact.

You got five days.

Build an artifact.

An artifact that's worth using day after day after day.

A week from now, you will be better at Midjourney and Anthropic, two of the top five AI tools.

Then 99.9% of the people on this planet.

See if that changes your approach.

See if that changes your attitude.

See if you can build that practice.

Okay, so my question regarding AI is what are the skills that a professional should focus on building

in the next, let's say, 2 to 5 years?

That will create the leverage for them in their career.

Because a lot is changing with AI, right?

Coding, marketing, copywriting, all these skills that used to be valued a lot earlier are Ah, seems

like they won't be valued that much.

So if you are investing in a career, where should we focus on to build our skillset?

Thanks for this, Saurabh.

So the essence is we're here to create value and we want AI to work for us, not to work for an AI.

What is the asset that we can build over time?

We can build a reputational asset.

We can build a skill asset.

We can build a library of prompts that we have written.

So following the rants that I've just shared with Bill and Mandel, the moment now is not to think about

the three year plan.

Let's start with the three week plan.

Here are these invisible virtual robots willing to work for you for free or close to free?

What would it mean to hire a lot of them, to put them to work, to create value, and then to do it

again and to do it again?

There's no way anyone, even Sam Altman, can predict what AI is going to be like in two years.

It's impossible.

But we can build an asset, an asset of being seen as a leader, a connector, a narrator, a teacher,

as somebody who has a squadron of unpaid interns ready to create value for the people who hire you.

That my friend Dan, who started the every newsletter, the every newsletter is now worth millions and

millions of dollars because he is connected.

The right people who want to learn about what's happening.

The same way Levi Strauss profited from the gold rush more than most people, because he went to San

Francisco to sell clothing to gold miners.

There are spectacular opportunities for people who want to build a reputation as someone who knows how

to use the tools, not someone who does tasks that are going to be replaced by the tools.

I'll be back with a couple more.
