Everyone loves Claude Skills!

The problem is that with all that attention we've discovered lots of common teething issues, and that's what this post is all about.

I went through my DMs and messages from the last week and found all the common issues with Claude Code:

* Skills that won't trigger
* Issues with zip files
* Context window overflows
* Questions about security if Skills run code
* Questions about how to evaluate Skills

The list goes on, and I decided to do something about it. So I sat down and looked across the issues and realized what we need is really a building kit for Claude Skills.

A set of tools that we can go back to to build skills with confidence, to troubleshoot them, etc.

Plus, we needed a clear guide with common pitfalls and tips and tricks, grounded in hard and real experience.

I wrote both. I wrote a guide for the common pitfalls and and I wrote 10 quick Claude Skills tools to help you get the most out of this powerful new tool. (And if you're still wondering what Claude Skills are, check out my intro post on that from last week.)

### 10 Tools Built

* **skill-debugging-assistant** - Fixes skills that won't trigger
* **skill-security-analyzer** - Audits third-party skills for malicious code
* **skill-gap-analyzer** - Identifies missing skills from repeated explanations
* **skill-performance-profiler** - Shows which skills waste tokens
* **prompt-optimization-analyzer** - Catches bad descriptions before deployment
* **skill-testing-framework** - Runs automated tests after changes
* **skill-doc-generator** - Creates consistent documentation across your library
* **skill-dependency-mapper** - Shows how skills interact and bottleneck
* **learning-capture** - Identifies patterns worth turning into skills
* **token-budget-advisor** - Tackles context limits with chunking strategies

If this is looking a little familiar, it should. This is the so-called boring toolset that treats Skills like what they are: code we can read in plain English.

I've been saying for months now that we should treat our prompts as code. As I wrote last week, Skills are super-leveraged prompts. Well, they're code too!

But I know we all don't have a ton of time, and we really just need to be able to build our own Skills for what we need and be confident they work.

That's exactly what this kit is for! It gives you everything you need to build the Skills you want with confidence—plus I show you two end-to-end examples in the video so you can see how I do it.

It has never been a better time to work using AI. Skills give us 10x leverage—I use them every day. I want you to have the same tools I have to build the Skills YOU want.

Have fun, and happy building!
