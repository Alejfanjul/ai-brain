## NEW: One Google Update Spawned 3 Startup Generations in 30 Days—Here's the Pattern + 4 Prompts to Position Before the Next Cascade

Faster than a speeding...nano banana lol. But seriously, things are about to move faster than we've ever seen--here's how to not only keep up, but get ahead.

I’ve been watching this space for years. I have never seen it move this fast.

One month ago, Google shipped Nano Banana Pro with professional-grade text rendering inside images. Today, I’m tracking startups using tools built on tools built on that release—three generations of businesses stacked in thirty days. Not research projects. Funded companies. Real products.

Here’s the mechanism most people miss: you don’t need to smooth the whole AI capability surface to unlock massive value. You need to fill in the *right* gap. Text inside images was that gap for business collateral. Every previous model could generate gorgeous visuals, but the moment you needed legible typography—a slide title, a marketing tagline—the output was unusable.

Now it isn’t. Fix one gap, unlock entire categories.

And this particular gap matters more than most—because we’re visual creatures first, text creatures second. Seeing is faster than reading. When AI moves from chat windows to images you can actually use, it taps into something more fundamental than text interfaces ever could.

If we’re three layers deep in a month on image generation, how many more gaps are about to close in 2026—and how many opportunities are you going to miss watching from the sidelines?

Here’s what’s inside:

* The jagged frontier framework—and why the 30% gains crowd will never catch the 300% gains crowd
* What Nano Banana Pro actually fixed, and the three failure modes that still break
* Five areas where we’re one unlock away from the next cascade
* How to map jaggedness in your own work before someone else does
* 4 prompts designed to help you successfully navigate the visual frontier

Understanding the pattern—where the gaps are, which ones are closing, and how to position before the cascade—is going to separate the builders from the spectators this year.

So let’s get building.
