And then the last one is this.

That understanding right now is more valuable than tactics.

And what I mean by this is you got to use it.

You got to use it for an hour or two a day.

You've got to be making movies in Mid-journey, because if you get good at making eight second clips

in Mid-journey, you will discover that if you want to, you can become a film director.

Not for big Hollywood motion pictures, but those don't get seen anymore anyway.

But to put online to share with other people that if you spend the time and understand the difference

between ChatGPT and Claude, if you understand how perplexity is going to completely upend the world

of search, if you understand, then you're going to start making different choices.

But if you wait, you're going to be waiting until someone has the power to tell you what to do.

And that would be a waste.

That would be a missed opportunity.

We need to talk about it.

We need to talk about it.

A long time ago, Josh Quittner wrote a story for wired magazine.

It was probably 19.

9193, 1993 about domain names.

He had bought Mcdonalds.com, and he had spent weeks trying to find someone at McDonald's who would

take for free the domain mcdonalds.com, because this was the dawn of the World Wide Web, and it was

a very amusing article.

I read it and went out and bought a dozen domains, some of which I still have, one of which I sold

for a bunch of money.

I wish I had bought 100.

I wanted to buy 100, but at least it talked me out of it.

The thing is, I got information from that article, not just amusement, when I read that article.

I saw in that article an opportunity to take information and use it in new ways to create value for

people.

And this is like that times a million, this moment in time.

Wired magazine isn't going to give you the answer.

You will find the answer.

You will discover all these fascinating ways to take what's here and what's about to be here.

Because wait till AI becomes social.

When AI becomes social, when you can invite other people to share their data with you to create transformative

interactions.

It's going to be like it is now times 100.

Everything keeps changing except our attitude.

We are stuck with the attitude we learned from Miss Ebert in fourth grade about sitting in straight

rows and following the instructions.

The instructions now are clear.

How can I create value?

Where do I get to say go?

How do I learn what is possible?

How do I put it to work in a way that doesn't hurt me or anybody else?

And when it works, how do I share it with other people?

So that's a half hour rant about an attitude shift that I think will pay off big time.

I'd like to end my rants by saying, go make a ruckus.

What?

Go make a ruckus means is simple.

It doesn't mean call attention to yourself.

It doesn't mean break things.

It means show up in a way that connects and leads and transforms.

It means show up and say, follow me.

It means show up and make generous mistakes.

Learn from your mistakes.

Share your mistakes, and then do it again.

When we make a ruckus, we make things better.

And Lord knows a lot of things need to be made better.

Who better than you to do that?

Thanks for listening.

We'll see you.
