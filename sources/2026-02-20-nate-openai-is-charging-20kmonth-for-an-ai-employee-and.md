If you’re still thinking about AI as a productivity tool for developers, you’re missing what’s actually happening: computing itself has changed form, and the second-order effects are already reshaping careers, org charts, and entire markets.  This isn’t about whether AI will replace developers. The developer role is splitting into three distinct tracks, and the middle of the old distribution is the most exposed. Enterprises are reorganizing around intelligence throughput instead of headcount. Startups now compete on distribution instead of compute. And the solopreneur suddenly has access to a factory.  Here’s what’s inside:   * **Token management is the new core competency.** What happens when companies get it wrong — and what it looks like when they get it right. * **The three developer tracks.** Orchestrators, systems builders, and domain translators — and which one matches your strengths. * **The 3x-5x revenue-per-employee gap.** How enterprises are restructuring around intelligence instead of headcount. * **Vertical AI is eating markets that were “too small.”** Why companies are raising hundreds of millions to serve niches. * **The economic case for going independent.** What changes when you combine domain expertise with AI fluency. * **Positioning for the commodity era.** How to find your edge when intelligence itself is no longer one.   Let me walk you through how each of these is playing out — and what it means for where you sit.  Subscribers get all posts like these!     LINK: Grab the prompts Five prompts in this kit, each built for a different reader. The Career Track Finder asks you six questions about your actual daily work — not your job title, your work — and scores you against the three tracks before building a 90-day transition plan with a weekly action table. The Token Management Audit scores your organization across five dimensions of intelligence spend and tells you, specifically, whether your AI budget is compounding or just burning. The Vertical AI Opportunity Finder takes the domain expertise you already have and pressure-tests it against market size, automation potential, and founder-market fit — because most people sitting on a viable product idea don't recognize it as one. The Solopreneur Business Case Builder runs your numbers at three customer scales, stress-tests the three assumptions most likely to kill you, and gives you a go/no-go. And the Engineering Org Restructuring Playbook is for the VP or CTO who knows the headcount model is breaking but needs a phased plan that doesn't detonate the team.  Every prompt has a hard input gate — if you leave blanks, it asks questions instead of guessing. That's deliberate. The New Unit of Work There are three kinds of developers now. One is about to get very rich, one is about to become obsolete, and the third doesn’t even know they’re a developer yet.  That sounds like clickbait. It’s not. It’s what happens when computing changes form — not incrementally, but categorically.  For sixty years, the unit of work in software was the instruction: a human wrote code, a machine executed it, and the value was denominated in how cleverly the human could sequence those instructions. The developer’s job was translation — turning business logic into machine logic, one function at a time.  That’s over. The unit of work is now the token.  A token is a unit of purchased intelligence — fundamentally different from an instruction. You don’t tell the machine what to do step by step. You describe what you want, feed it context, and buy enough inference to get a result. The machine figures out the steps. The human’s job shifts from writing the logic to specifying the outcome and managing the intelligence budget that produces it.  Computing itself has changed form — this goes well beyond a tools upgrade. And once you see it that way — once you follow the second-order effects on careers, companies, and entire markets — the three kinds of developers I just mentioned stop sounding like a provocation and start sounding like a map. The Paradigm, Not the Price Tag I’ve been collecting these numbers for months, and they’re all telling the same story.  A security company called StrongDM has described an operating model where their engineering team targets roughly $1,000 per developer per day in token spend — three engineers, no human code review, agents writing, testing, and shipping. Cursor — the AI coding editor that became Anthropic’s single largest customer and hit $200 million in annualized revenue by mid-2025 according to the Financial Times — saw its infrastructure costs spike sharply after Anthropic restructured its pricing tiers. Perplexity, the AI search company, was estimated to have spent roughly 164% of its revenue on compute from AWS, Anthropic, and OpenAI in 2024 — a figure that circulated widely in industry analysis, though the company hasn’t publicly confirmed it. Anthropic’s AWS bill has been reported at roughly $2.66 billion against an estimated $2.55 billion in revenue — meaning the company may be spending more than 100% of its top line on compute alone. Notion reportedly saw AI features consume roughly 10% of its profit margins, according to Wall Street Journal reporting.  These numbers landed like grenades in different communities. But the discourse keeps anchoring on the wrong thing — the dollar figures — and missing what they collectively represent.  None of these companies found an expensive way to do what they were already doing. They’re all operating in a fundamentally different model of computing. Intelligence is now a purchasable input — a commodity with a price curve, a consumption curve, and a set of second-order effects that are about to reshape how every organization that touches software actually operates.  The price curve tells the first part of the story. Per-token inference costs have been falling at rates that make Moore’s Law look gentle — roughly 5x to 10x per year for equivalent performance, according to Andreessen Horowitz’s “LLMflation” analysis and corroborating academic research. GPT-4-level performance that cost around $20 per million tokens at launch now runs under $1 — a deflation curve with few parallels in computing history. Claude 4.5 Sonnet runs at $3 per million input tokens.  But the consumption curve is where it gets strange. When a resource gets dramatically cheaper, you don’t use less of it. You use catastrophically more. This is Jevons Paradox — the observation that efficiency gains in resource use lead to increased total consumption, not decreased. Steam engines got more efficient; coal consumption exploded. Cloud computing got cheaper; AWS bills went up, not down. Satya Nadella invoked the paradox by name after DeepSeek’s efficiency breakthroughs: “As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can’t get enough of.”  He was defending Microsoft’s infrastructure spending, but he was also — maybe accidentally — describing the new physics of everything built on top of it. According to CloudZero’s 2025 State of AI Costs report, the average organization now spends over $85,000 a month on AI — up 36% year-over-year — and the share planning to spend more than $100,000 monthly has more than doubled, from 20% to 45%. OpenAI is reportedly planning agent pricing tiers at $2,000 a month for knowledge-worker agents, $10,000 for specialized software development, and $20,000 for PhD-level research — and the enterprise buyers doing the math are concluding that these prices are cheap relative to the human professionals they’d otherwise employ.  The price per unit of intelligence is collapsing while the number of units consumed — per engineer, per company, per industry — is exploding. The gap between what different levels of consumption can produce widens every week, and that gap is where the interesting effects start — not in the price tag, but in what happens to an entire economy when intelligence becomes a variable cost you can dial up or down. Token management is the new core competency For decades, the scarce resource was developer time. You hired engineers, gave them tools, and the constraint on output was how many hours of skilled labor you could deploy. The management challenge was headcount planning, recruiting, retention — all the machinery of human capital management.  That constraint just moved. The scarce resource is now the ability to convert tokens into value. The raw intelligence is abundant and getting cheaper. What’s scarce is knowing how to aim it — how to structure context, route tasks to the right model at the right cost, build agent loops that sustain quality over long autonomous runs, and measure whether the intelligence you’re purchasing is actually producing the outcomes you need.  This creates an entirely new organizational capability. Call it token management, intelligence operations, context engineering — the name doesn’t matter yet. What matters is that it’s real, it’s measurable, and the organizations that build it first are pulling away from everyone else.  The enterprises that have figured this out are building internal platforms that route work to the right model at the right price point — the cheap model for high-volume low-stakes tasks, the frontier model for the hard stuff, a mid-tier model for everything in between. They’re treating token spend not as a cost to minimize but as a lever to maximize, subject to ROI constraints. They negotiate custom API agreements with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google. They commit to consumption floors in exchange for dedicated capacity and volume pricing.  Andreessen Horowitz’s enterprise AI survey found that average enterprise LLM spend hit $7 million in 2025, up from $4.5 million two years prior, with projections of $11.6 million for 2026. And the spending shifted from innovation budgets (down from 25% to 7% of LLM spend in a single year) to centralized IT and business unit budgets. The language moved from “let’s explore” to “this is infrastructure.”  The flip side of this capability shows up when token management goes wrong. Cursor — which reached $200 million ARR faster than almost any developer tool in history — found itself in a structural trap. It sends essentially all of its revenue to Anthropic in API costs. When Anthropic introduced priority tiers and restructured caching prices in mid-2025, Cursor’s cost structure broke. The company gutted its unlimited $20-a-month plan and introduced a $200-a-month tier. Users revolted — the subreddit turned into a complaint forum, and Cursor’s own blog acknowledged the pricing changes were poorly communicated. The takeaway isn’t cost — it’s dependency. Token economics is now a core business competency, and companies that don’t master it are one supplier pricing change away from a crisis.  The part that should worry you: this capability is not evenly distributed, and it won’t be for a long time. The organizations building token management as a core competency are compounding their advantage with every model upgrade. Each new Opus, each new GPT iteration, each Gemini release makes their existing systems more capable without costing a dollar more. The flywheel spins faster for anyone already on it. Three tracks, one choice Now it gets personal — especially if you write software for a living, and especially because most of the current discourse is getting it wrong.  The standard narrative is binary: either AI replaces developers or it doesn’t. I’ve watched this debate go in circles for two years now, and the framing is useless. What’s actually happening is that the role of the developer is differentiating into at least three distinct tracks, each with different skill requirements, different compensation dynamics, and different career trajectories.  Track 1: The Orchestrator. This is the StrongDM model — the developer who doesn’t write code but specifies outcomes and manages the intelligence that produces them. The core skills are system design, specification writing, quality evaluation, and token economics. These developers think in terms of agent architectures, context windows, evaluation frameworks, and cost-per-outcome. They are, effectively, factory managers for intelligence. Their value scales with the volume of intelligence they can direct, which means their compensation will correlate with token budgets, not with lines of code. This track favors people who are excellent at decomposing problems, writing precise specifications, and evaluating output quality — skills that overlap with but are not identical to traditional engineering.  Track 2: The Systems Builder. Someone has to build the infrastructure that the orchestrators use. The agent frameworks, the evaluation pipelines, the context management systems, the routing layers that send the right task to the right model at the right cost. This is deep technical work — closer to traditional systems engineering than to application development, but with an entirely new stack. These developers need to understand model behavior at a mechanical level: how context windows affect output quality, how different architectures handle different task types, how to build reliable systems on top of probabilistic components. This track is smaller and more specialized, but the compensation ceiling is very high because the leverage is enormous.  Track 3: The Domain Translator. This is the track that almost nobody is talking about, and it may be the largest of the three. These are the developers — or, increasingly, the non-developers — who combine enough technical fluency to work with AI systems and deep enough domain expertise to know which problems are worth solving in a specific market. The dental practice management specialist. The construction scheduling expert. The insurance compliance analyst who can now build tools instead of just using them. Their value isn’t in their ability to manage tokens or build infrastructure. It’s in their ability to point intelligence at the right problem in the right market with the right context. And that value is increasing as intelligence gets cheaper, because cheaper intelligence makes more niche problems economically viable to solve.  The career implication is stark: the middle of the old distribution — the developer who writes competent application code but doesn’t have deep systems expertise or deep domain expertise — is the most exposed. Not because AI replaces them tomorrow. Because the value of generic code production is deflating at the same rate as the cost of tokens. The developers who thrive will be the ones who move decisively toward one of these three tracks, ideally the one that best matches their existing strengths and interests. The org chart is repricing too When the unit of work changes, the organizational structures built around the old unit of work become liabilities.  Most enterprise engineering organizations are structured around headcount. Budgets are denominated in FTEs, productivity is measured (badly) in output-per-engineer, and hiring plans are built around projected workload. The entire machinery of engineering management assumes that the constraint on output is the number of skilled humans you can recruit, retain, and coordinate.  In a token-based world, the constraint shifts. Output is limited not by headcount but by the ability to convert intelligence spend into business value. An organization that employs 500 engineers writing code by hand may produce less than an organization that employs 50 engineers managing agents — if the 50-person org has better specifications, better evaluation frameworks, better context engineering, and a higher token budget.  This doesn’t mean enterprises will fire 90% of their engineers next quarter. Organizational change is slow, political, and path-dependent. But it does mean that the enterprises which figure out the new model first will develop a compounding advantage that looks, from the outside, like inexplicable productivity.  Klarna is the clearest example so far. The fintech reduced its workforce from roughly 7,000 to around 3,000 over three years while growing revenue significantly. AI now handles the work of 853 full-time customer service staff. Revenue per employee is approaching $1 million, up from $575,000. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told Bloomberg he believes “the world isn’t ready for the impact AI will have on knowledge work.” That’s not speculation — it’s an after-action report from inside his own company.  The Andreessen Horowitz data shows this pattern spreading: AI-native companies are running at 3x to 5x the revenue-per-employee of traditional SaaS companies. A $10 million ARR AI startup might operate with 15 to 20 people where a traditional company would need 50 to 70. That ratio will widen as the tooling matures, and it will eventually force larger organizations to restructure or accept a permanent productivity disadvantage.  The second-order enterprise effect is subtler and more important: what gets built changes when the cost of building falls. Every enterprise has a backlog of projects that were never economically viable — the internal tool that would save 200 hours a year but costs 2,000 hours to build, the integration that would unlock a new revenue stream but requires a team of four for six months, the analytics dashboard that everyone wants but nobody can justify staffing. When the cost of building falls by an order of magnitude, that backlog becomes a goldmine. The enterprises that recognize this will dramatically expand the scope of what they build, not just the speed at which they build it. The ones that don’t will continue optimizing headcount while their competitors optimize output. Distribution beats compute This is where the story gets interesting if you’re not a Fortune 500 company.  The enterprises will always win the token volume game. Goldman Sachs will spend more on inference than you. JPMorgan will commit to larger consumption contracts. The Fortune 500 will negotiate the best per-token rates. If the competitive axis is “who can purchase the most intelligence,” the incumbents win by definition. They have the revenue base to fund the flywheel.  But intelligence is a commodity. And when the core input is commoditized, the competitive advantage migrates to everything around the commodity — distribution, domain expertise, customer relationships, proprietary data, workflow integration, brand, trust.  Goldman Sachs can run more inference than you. But Goldman Sachs cannot sell AI-powered inventory management to a 50-location restaurant chain — and that’s the whole point. The intelligence is purchasable. The channel never will be.  For startups, this inverts the usual venture capital logic entirely. The old VC wisdom was that niche markets weren’t venture-backable — the TAMs were too small, the unit economics didn’t justify the engineering investment. AI rewrites that math in two ways.  First, the cost of building falls so dramatically that markets which couldn’t support a software company suddenly can. Every workflow that lived in spreadsheets and email because nobody could afford to build the tool now gets a tool. The addressable market for software expands not incrementally but explosively — Jevons Paradox applied to software itself.  Second, and this is the part most people miss: vertical AI companies aren’t just replacing software licenses. They’re replacing labor and services spend. A market that looked like a $200 million opportunity when you were selling software licenses becomes multiples of that when your product automates the services around that software. Bessemer Venture Partners published a thesis this year arguing that vertical AI has the potential to eclipse even the most successful legacy vertical SaaS markets precisely because the addressable spend is fundamentally larger.  The data supports this. Harvey raised $300 million for legal AI. EliseAI raised $250 million for real estate. Vertical AI companies are growing at a median 31% versus 28% for horizontal players. The money is chasing specificity because the returns on specificity are defensible in a way that returns on generic intelligence are not.  The startup playbook in this paradigm isn’t “raise more money to buy more tokens.” It’s “know a market so well that a $200-a-month Claude Max subscription, aimed precisely, creates more value than a $20,000-a-month agent budget pointed at the wrong problem.” Distribution beats compute. Knowing your customer beats knowing your API. The solopreneur gets a factory Almost nobody is paying attention to this one yet, and I think it may matter more than any of the others.  When intelligence is purchasable by the token and the cost of building software falls by an order of magnitude, the minimum viable team for a real software business approaches one. Not one person with a prototype. One person with a product, customers, revenue, and a defensible market position.  This has been theoretically possible for a few years. It’s now practically happening. The solopreneur or tiny team that combines domain expertise with AI fluency can build, ship, and maintain software products that would have required a team of ten or twenty just five years ago. The economics are brutal in the best sense: near-zero marginal cost of production, token spend that scales with usage (and therefore with revenue), no payroll beyond the founder, and a distribution advantage that comes from being embedded in a specific market that no horizontal platform will ever bother to serve.  The career implication is that “going independent” is no longer a lifestyle trade-off. It’s increasingly a rational economic choice for anyone with deep domain knowledge and sufficient AI fluency. The expected value calculation has changed: the downside risk is lower (because the cost of building is lower), the upside potential is higher (because the markets are expanding), and the probability of finding a viable niche is dramatically better (because cheaper intelligence makes more niches economically viable).  I’m not saying everyone should quit their job tomorrow. But the option value of domain expertise plus AI fluency is rising fast enough that anyone not building both is leaving career optionality on the table. The Strategic Frame The market is splitting. That much is obvious. But it’s not splitting into haves and have-nots based on token budget. It’s splitting along a more interesting axis: generalized scale versus specialized precision.  At the top: enterprises and well-funded AI-native companies competing on token volume, building horizontal platforms, running agents around the clock on the broad workflows that every large organization shares. Their advantage compounds with every model upgrade. Their moat is capital and infrastructure.  Across the enormous surface area of everything else: builders competing on specificity — the sharp angle, the niche market, the customer relationship that no amount of token spend can replicate. Their advantage compounds with domain knowledge. Their moat is distribution and trust.  Both sides benefit from the same underlying trend: intelligence is getting cheaper, and cheaper intelligence makes more things possible. The enterprises use that to scale horizontally. The specialists use it to go deeper vertically. The paradigm shift doesn’t pick a winner between them. It makes both strategies more powerful and widens the gap between either strategy and the old model of writing code by hand.  Developer careers are splitting into orchestrators, systems builders, and domain translators. Enterprise org charts are reorganizing around intelligence throughput. Startups are competing on distribution instead of compute — and solopreneurs are getting factories.  None of this is inevitable in its specifics. All of it is directional. The unit of work has changed. Everything built on the old unit is now repricing. The question isn’t whether you can afford $1,000 a day in tokens. The question is whether you understand what computing has become, and whether you’re positioning yourself — your career, your company, your product — for the world that follows from that understanding.  Intelligence is a commodity now. What you do with it never will be.  I make this Substack thanks to readers like you!
