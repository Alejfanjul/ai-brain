Today, I’m excited to dive into Principles.  Principles are one of the most effective tools I’ve come across when it comes to making great decisions. They are powerful yet simple pointers to the deeper patterns running your life, the roadsigns you’re already following, whether you know it or not. **The Two Students** A guitar teacher gave two students an assignment to see who would get the lead spot in the band.  He asked them to learn how to play three songs: A rock classic, a jazz classic, and a bluegrass classic.  He gave them a month to practice before the audition.  The first student went home and pulled up videos of the greatest jazz, rock, and classic guitarists alive. He slowed every clip down, studied every finger movement, every bend, every flourish. He tried to copy it all. His version of the songs sounded almost exactly like the legend players he studied.  The second student went home, sat on the floor, and asked himself what would make the pieces feel good to play. He tilted the rhythm until it clicked in his body. He bent certain notes because they made him grin. He practiced twice as long without noticing, because it felt like play. By the end, the pieces didn’t sound like anyone else’s. It sounded like him.  When they returned, the teacher listened carefully.  When they were finished, he said, “Technically, you were both amazing.”  He pointed to the second student. “But I am picking you for the role because you play beautifully and like nobody I’ve ever heard before.” **Lesson 5: Using principles to reclaim your life**  Most folks don’t realize that all of us are already operating on a set of principles, even if we don't know it.  The principle might be: “I need to please my guitar teacher” or “I need to play the song perfectly” or “I want to love playing guitar.” Whatever it is, it's leading your life.  Much of the work we’ve been doing in this Prep Guide is helping you bring these unconscious principles into the light, because they tend to be driven by the emotions you’re trying to grasp or avoid.  Once you become aware of these principles, you can choose which ones align with what you actually want in your world.  It often takes some upfront effort, but it saves endless time and energy on the backend, and makes decision-making effortless. The principle becomes the authority rather than your avoidance, mood, or fear.  And living by clear principles cut out overthinking, rehashing, politicking, and fear-based decision loops.  This is exactly what we’ll be doing during the course. By the end of the five weeks, you’ll walk out with a powerful set of principles that you’ve designed on your own. We’ll show you how to test them, refine them, and experiment with them until they make your decision-making effortless. Here are the principles (that have taken me years to distill and refine) that we use at AOA to run our company:   |  | | --- | | ​ |  |  | | --- | | **Experiment 5: Principles**   1. Take the 10 biggest decisions you've made in the last year 2. Name at least 3 principles you made those decisions on.   For example   * Decision: I decided to work late.  Principle: Hard work gets you money. * Decision: Hang out with friends.  Principle: It’s healthy to be in community * Decision: Acquiesce to my boyfriend’s wants.  Principle: I’ll be loved if I don’t create conflict. |   Big Love,  Joe  PS. Missed previous Prep Guide emails?
