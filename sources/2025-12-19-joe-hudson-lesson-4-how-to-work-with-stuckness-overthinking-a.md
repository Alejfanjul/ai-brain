If you can’t welcome the emotion, welcome the resistance.

I’d love to hear how it went (you can reply directly to this email).  As many of you are discovering, working with avoided emotions can be a challenging process. We’ve spent so much of our lives running away, that it feels unfamiliar to simply be with them.  Don’t worry if you felt confused or stuck during any of the recording. This is something we’ll be exploring in depth during the course. Throughout the five weeks, you’ll have dedicated support and a forum where you can post questions and get coaching from our facilitators.  Plus, today’s lesson will be all about how to work with the different forms of resistance that are bound to come up. **The Third Knot** A young warrior went to a mountain temple to hone his craft. “I am ready to learn how to be a warrior,” he said eagerly to the teacher.  The teacher nodded and handed him a tightly knotted length of rope.  “Your first task,” he said, “is to untie this knot. There’s only one rule: You may not pull on it.”  The warrior took the knot and got to work. He sat in the courtyard tugging, pinching, and twisting. His fingers slipped and pulled the knot a little more. Each time he noticed, he jerked his hands back in frustration.  By dusk, the knot was smaller and harder than before. His shoulders burned as he marched back to the teacher.  “This is impossible. The moment I work on the knot, I end up pulling. And every time I try not to pull, I end up yanking my hands away. I can’t do this.”  The teacher glanced at him. “So now there are two knots,” he said. “The one in the rope and the one in your body.”   |  | | --- | | blue rope tied on brown rope   ​ |   “Try again tomorrow,” he said.  The next morning, the young student decided to be more disciplined.  “I will not resist,” he told himself.  He forced his shoulders down and straightened his spine. He breathed in a perfectly even rhythm, willing his mind to be calm. When irritation arose, he clamped down even harder.  After an hour, sweat ran down his back. The knot was even tighter.  He stormed back to the teacher, exhausted and exasperated: “I didn’t pull. I stayed calm and controlled my reactions. Nothing is moving!”  The teacher raised an eyebrow. “You controlled your reactions?”  “Yes. I refused to get frustrated or tense up.”  “So now, there is a third knot.” The teacher nodded. “Tomorrow. Again.”  The next morning, the student went back to the courtyard and sat down with the rope in his lap. For a long time he did nothing.  He noticed the tightness in his throat, his desire to impress the teacher, and the shame that he hadn’t yet solved it. He welcomed all of it.  Then, slowly, he picked up the rope and turned the knot over in his hands. He felt how the strands crossed and bit into each other. He learned its weight, its grain, the way it folded back on itself.  And then it hit him all at once. He knew what to do.  He went to the teacher, and asked “Please put your fingers here and pull.”  The knot came undone instantly.  The teacher smiled. “Congratulations. You have undone all three knots. And you have learned the first lesson of being a warrior: In a fight with yourself, you always lose.” **Lesson 4: How to work with stuckness, overthinking, and analysis paralysis** If you can’t welcome the emotion, welcome the resistance.  As you start working more closely with long-avoided emotions, you will eventually come across many forms of resistance. You may feel stuck, plagued by chronic overthinking, or overwhelmed by analysis paralysis.  Resistance is a natural part of the process. It’s what arises when you reach the edge of what you’ve been willing to feel.  Most people try to overpower this resistance. We push harder, double down on discipline, or try to unpack the emotion with analysis. But these are all just different forms of resistance. And as the young student discovered, resisting your resistance simply leads to more and more knots.  The most effective way to work with these patterns is to welcome your resistance with wonder.  Why? Because wonder is the most powerful antidote to fear. And underneath each of these patterns is fear:   * Stuckness happens when you’re afraid to feel the consequences of following your truth, and so you call yourself stuck. * Overthinking is one of the clearest signs that you’re repressing an emotion you’re afraid to feel. * And analysis paralysis is built on the fear of making the wrong choice or risking uncertainty in an inherently uncertain life.   Try this experiment below to see it for yourself:   |  |  | | --- | --- | | **Experiment 4: Wonder**  Find a quiet space where you will be uninterrupted for 15 minutes.  Today, we're going to be seeing how wonder and fear interact:   |  | | --- | | **Watch: Wonder** | |   Big Love,  Joe  PS. Missed previous Prep Guide emails?
