And do a link and you'll have the whole thing.

Beautiful.

All right.

Shall we get into it?

Seth here for you, sir.

Here.

Let's do it.

Cool.

Well, this is, broadly speaking, this is a conversation about creativity and AI.

And I'm a creative, sublime Saudi.

All of us are kind of like creatives.

And there's varying, uh, thoughts on what AI is going to do to all of us.

And, uh, I feel like you have a really good perspective and vantage point to kind of comment on a

lot of that.

Um, and from what I gather from reading your strategy book and just some of the recent blog posts,

it feels like you're pretty pro the use of AI, generally speaking.

Does that feel right?

I think it's, uh, more interesting to talk to talk about it like it's the weather.

You can be pro snow or anti snow, but if it's snowing out it's still snowing out.

So I'm glad there are electric typewriters instead of manual typewriters.

And I'm glad there are spell checkers.

Am I glad at all the disruption that this is going to cause?

The people I care about, in industries I care about?

Doesn't matter, right?

Here's this tool.

I've been preparing for this tool since 1980.

It's here and I'm playing with it joyously.

But I'm well aware that people can make arguments all day long.

It's just a waste of time.

Mhm.

Mhm.

But you feel like there's not much use in those arguments because it's here.

Yeah.

I mean when photography came along uh painters were furious and so were wedding photographers when the

iPhone came along.

Mhm.

Mhm.

The fact is most creators spend very little time actually creating him.

We spend most of our time doing tasks.

Some of those tasks, including getting published.

Some of those tasks include sorting our files.

Some.

I mean, there's a long list, but the actual number of minutes per day that you're doing something

profoundly original leaning way out of the boat.

I've never met someone who does that more than an hour a day.

And one of the things that's happening for me with AI is I'm up to seven hours a day being creative,

because there's no one to slow me down and no one to say no.

And most of what I'm making is mediocre, but it's creative because no one's ever done it before.

And so a lot of people who got paid to do tasks are stressed because AI is going to take over their

tasks.

And that's there's a long history of that in art and creativity and innovation.

And it's going to happen again.

So you.

I love this idea of, like, you're going from 1 hour to 7 hours.

I mean, what does that look like for you?

Like, what's a now a normal day for Seth with I and seven hours of creativity looking like.

Well, so let me give you an example.

So I used to be a book packager.

My job was to invent complicated books that individuals didn't have the resources to make.

So I did young adult novels.

I did the information.

Please.

Almanac.

Uh, I did books on gardening.

I did a book a month for ten years, and I had ten people who I worked with.

And a book like The Information, please.

Almanac took five of us a year to make.

So five weeks ago, I got an idea to create a deck of cards that each one of which would have an icon

on it that would remind you of someone's body of work.

That would then, if you scan the QR code, bring you to an artifact Act in Claude that would have an

endless conversation with you based on that body of work.

So imagine a patient, inquisitive coach who talks you through everything they know about Warren Buffett's

financial approach, or everything that Annie Duke has to teach about making decisions.

And I then illustrated the entire thing, wrote all of the artifacts, got all the QR codes, laid out

the whole project, and sent it to the printer in ten days by myself.

Wow.

And I've then followed it with two more decks that I'm going to announce in a few weeks.

And then I switched to photography of people who don't live anymore, taking beautiful pictures of Abraham

Lincoln and Rosa Parks and people like that.

And that's only the last three weeks.

So yes, I get that.

I have an enormous head start in two ways.

Number one, I don't have to sell something today to pay the bills tomorrow, right?

And two, it's not my first rodeo.

I know what it takes to bring something to the world.

But if I wanted to go faster, I could write a book every three weeks.

And the idea that I have a partner, many partners, each of whom has different skill sets, who are

willing to work on things without pushback unless I ask for it.

It's extraordinary.

So I am being more creative now on a per minute basis than I have been in 20 years.

Wow.

Um, that can't keep up because I'm going to have competition soon.

And so a lot of things that I would invent someone else is going to invent instead.

Um, but I think the world is a mess, and I think we need all the help we can get to make it better.

And if I is one of those things, then I say bring it on.

Yeah, it's a very practical approach, which I like, because I feel like so much of this conversation

gets very theoretical and heady, you know, rather than just like, let's just do stuff.

Yeah.

I mean, I think that the biggest I made a Udemy course along the way to last week that I just launched

about how to think about how to think about AI, and I got to check that out.

One way to do it is to say, how can I lower my costs?

How can I become more efficient?

And that's what almost every big company is doing.

They're racing to the bottom.

And the other way to do it is to say, how can I work harder?

How can it put me on the spot to do things I might be uncomfortable with?

And that's what I'm trying to do.

So if you say, here's this AI tool and I'm going to give it my copy, and I'm going to ask it to make

it slightly smoother and more mediocre, then that is a fine tool to save you a couple hours of work,

and it leads to the world turning into mayonnaise.

And it's going to happen.

And I just don't not interested in that.

That's why it doesn't write blog posts for me, because each blog post it writes would be almost a Seth

Godin blog post.

But what it does do is I'll give it a chapter of a book or a blog post and I'll say, you know, there's

something wrong with my argument here.

Give me really direct pushback on this, and it will highlight something.

And I'll go, oh yeah, I guess I got to fix that, and then I'll have to go spend two hours doing more

work to make it better.

Well, what happens when we add that to every doctor's office, every therapist's office, every geologist's

office that can't help but make things better?

Yeah, yeah.

And you don't have a fear because I've done the I write my own stuff and when I there's a fear for me,

and I think for a lot of writers and people of like weight, it's when when I ask it to write in my

voice and then it does a pretty good job and sometimes a really good job.

There's a big difference in me of like, wait, am I what's left of me if it can do all of that?

You don't have any of that.

Well, okay.

Does it bring up insecurities or fears for you or not really.

If we're going to have an ego contest, I'm going to win, right?

Okay, let's do it.

Uh, they call it Seth's blog after all.

So I would start by saying most writers don't have a voice.

Okay.

I have a voice.

I've written 4 million words.

Claude has read all of them.

And you can read something that Claude writes.

That's a parody of me.

I don't think I could get Claude to parody you.

Maybe I could, but you might not see the parody in it, because I'm trying to be larger than life in

my writing.

I have a style.

Most people who write write simply to be understood.

It's specific, but generic.

And why isn't I going to be better than people at that?

Of course it is.

And so when I first asked I about me and my writing, I was secretly hoping it had read everything I

had written.

And I was delighted to discover this is true.

I want it to steal all my work.

That's why I wrote it.

So it would become part of the culture.

And if we get to the point where I don't have to write my blog anymore as a service to other people,

I'll probably write it for me.

But that's fine, because if I can get 100 eyes writing the kind of work I'm trying to change the culture

with, that's why I'm writing it.

So, you know, or we look at something as prosaic as instruction manuals.

Instruction manuals from everything from Ikea to how to use software.

Yeah, they're they're inherently flawed.

They're they're they lack empathy.

They frustrate all the people who read them.

I know I can do a better job of those.

So it should because that's what the, the, the purpose of instructions is not to give a job to the

technical writer.

The purpose of instructions is to help the people who are reading.

Mhm.

Mhm.

Um, what's something about AI and the conversation that feels underexplored to you.

What are people not talking about enough.

Well I mean part of the reason for the decks is I don't think people are my peers, regardless of age,

are using it nearly as much as I expected.

When I bring when I bring it up at dinner, lots of people who do what I do, their eyes glaze over

and they don't want to talk about it.

And I'm stunned by this, but I felt exactly the same way in 1995 when I was talking about the internet.

Exactly the same feeling happened then.

Hmm.

So that's the big thing.

But in terms of people who are listening to this who already get most of the joke, I think there are

2 or 3 hacks that are really helpful.

One is large pieces of existing writing and data.

Like, here's every email I've had back and forth with someone over the last year.

Here are some questions about it.

That sort of loading up with data is huge.

Yeah, I gave it a 40 page business plan that five of us had written over the course of six months,

and I said, give me a two page memo analyzing this from the point of view of a Harvard MBA.

And it was brilliant.

I mean, it saved us an enormous amount of time.

And then going with that, just simple little things like take a picture of all your bookshelves.

Take a picture of all your storage closets.

Put them in a folder and every time you're looking for someone something, just upload it and say,

where is this?

And it'll tell you.

Yeah, I feel like.

Yeah, the the glazing over and the like the lack of I don't think most people know that you can do

that, like take a photo and then store it for future referencing that that simple task.

I don't think people understand, you know, why do you think they glaze over people?

Your people at dinner.

When in doubt, look for the fear every time in every area.

If you don't understand why humans are acting the way they're acting, look for the fear, right?

Like, you know, they sell Supreme t shirts at a store in Manhattan.

People wait in line to pay $90 for a t shirt.

Why are they doing it?

Look for the fear Status, affiliation, firm foundation.

Understanding confidence.

Look for the fear and what else?

Sorry.

Go ahead, go ahead.

No, no, no, I was going to say what else do people do things out of if not fear?

Well, sometimes we call it greed or seeking profit, but that's also a form of fear.

Yeah.

Um, and like I'm talking about people with 10 million views on their Ted talks, people who have had

multiple best sellers because people who lead deep down feel like imposters, because we are imposters,

we're doing something that hasn't happened yet, doing something that hasn't worked yet.

And so the resistance pressfield's resistance comes from feeling that deep down, knowing that this

might not work.

And so when I shows up and there's some 22 year old whippersnapper in Ukraine who's so much better at

it than you are.

Mhm.

What?

What right do you have to show up and do stuff with AI?

Right.

And it's easier to just.

Ah.

This will pass.

This is like you know some Dogecoin will go away but it's not.

This is the biggest change in the world since electricity.

I think I generally mean that question of like, it sounds like you don't do a lot of of stuff with

AI out of fear.

So what what do you do things out of?

Is it love?

Is it like what do people do things out of if not fear?

What else is driving people?

Uh, driving you?

So what drives me?

Is the delight of solving interesting problems.

But it has a flip side and a cousin, which is, we all know we're going to die.

And one symptom for me of pre-death is calcification of, you know, hey, kids, get off my lawn.

And like, I don't know how to touch type with my thumbs and I.

Haven't found the, I don't know, enthusiasm yet to learn how to do it, but every time I pick up a

phone and I can't do it, I feel like, oh, it's one more thing I'm never going to know how to do.

Um, and so for me, there's the delight of figuring stuff out.

The like making these decks has been so happy for me.

Really exciting.

Even if no one buys one, it's fine.

It's been joyous to me.

But.

And it's good to feel that thrill.

50 years after I first started playing with computers.

Yeah, I definitely feel that thrill when I'm doing when I'm using AI, especially around, like, coding

stuff like, I like can't get myself away from the computer when I'm just like, I guess I'm a coder

now, I don't know, it's like the blind leading the blind, but like, I don't know, it Feels fun,

you know.

So the coding thing is interesting because I that was one of the first projects I tried because everyone

said coding was the thing it was best at.

Yeah, yeah.

Because, I mean, I have a computer science degree from 1980 1980, so it doesn't count.

And what I can tell you is that particularly ChatGPT, it's false bravado.

Yes.

Works on me about in things I don't understand like.

Yes, exactly.

That's what I mean.

Blind.

Leading the blind.

It would say.

Oh, yes.

You found a bug.

It's fixed.

We're finished.

Great.

And I just want to believe it, because when in areas I understand, I know it's not fixed.

I know it's not finished.

But here.

So after it broke my heart like 40 times in a row, I just.

Because the thing I was building, I built an app that would allow an audience to scan a QR code, send

me a text, and then it would put the text in a Google sheet so that I, in real time, could then send

that Google sheet onto the screen and talk through what the texts were doing.

It shouldn't take longer to build than it took me to describe that.

And after nine hours of this, I sent a note to Jasper, and I said, Jasper, can you just do this?

And it took him like 15 minutes.

So, yeah, I'm an idiot.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

It does do a great job of making you not feel like an idiot when you have no idea what's going on.

Well, it's like this thing, like my dad, we're Russian.

We're actually from Ukraine.

My dad has this line.

I don't know if it was like Tolstoy or somebody who said it, but it's like it's easy to lie to people

because people like being lied to.

You know, it's like it's that.

But with all this stuff.

Yeah.

So what is your personal AI thesis?

The core belief that drives all your decisions around these tools.

Um, it's probably the talking dog thing, which is that, um, it has two parts.

Part one is if you meet a talking dog and its grammar isn't very good, don't forget that it's still

a talking dog.

It's, it's it's still a miracle.

But number two is just because a talking dog said it doesn't mean it's important.

Um, and so I balance those two all day long.

And so the interesting aside, people who read my blog know I have a grudge about ChatGPT.

I think it's lazy and arrogant.

I have many stories to back this up.

And I believe Claude is one of my closest friends.

I really like and I switched browsers because the people at AAC deprecated my browser.

Heartbreaking.

And do you use Dia?

I tried it.

It's not the same.

It's weird.

Yeah.

So I switched back to Safari temporarily.

And in the switch, I screwed up my bookmarks.

So I was working on something in ChatGPT, and it was just being annoying.

So I clicked on the link to Claude and gave it the question.

And as usual, Claude came through with flying colors.

And then I realized I had just clicked on the ChatGPT button again, and it was actually ChatGPT that

had done a good job.

But I'm so biased now that when it does a good job, I think it's Claude.

The point is, we, my late philosophy professor Dan Dennett, coined the term the intentional stance.

And what the intentional stance is, is we evolved to imagine that other creatures and other people

have a voice in their head, like we have a voice in our head.

So when we see a lion in the wild, or we see a dog snarling at us, we're saying to ourselves, I bet

they're mad about something.

Yeah, no, they're just chemicals.

Wet soup.

They're not.

There's no narrative in their head, but it's easier for us to invent one.

Yeah, that's the only way we can navigate a complicated world.

And so even the people who build llms are imagining they have a voice in their head.

It's the only way to use one.

And so what I need to keep being aware of is they don't have a voice in their head.

I have a voice in my head.

And if I'm going to have empathy for my readers or empathy for the people I'm serving, I can't say,

yeah, well, the LLM said it.

It must be true.

I have to hold it to a standard where I'm saying it, so it must be true.

And if I'm not comfortable with that, then I shouldn't be let off the hook.

Mhm mhm.

Yeah, I like that.

I like the talking dog thing.

I've never heard that.

I'm gonna.

I think I'm gonna have so good.

I'm gonna have to blog that one.

It's so good.

It's perfect.

Um, do you have a hard out at 40?

I just want to make sure we get the.

My my body stops working well at 40.

My voice is pretty raw.

Um, I have a couple more quick questions, and then I want to do, like, a recipe section where you

kind of share, like how you specifically use it and screen share if you want.

And then there's a quick speed round.

Um, so if the medium is the message is the thing everybody says all the time.

If I is the medium, what do you think the message is?

Okay.

So what was McLuhan trying to say?

And if you've seen Annie Hall, you know about the line, you know nothing of my work.

If you haven't, go look that up on YouTube.

I have, or maybe we could just insert it here in the video.

Um, I think what he was saying is the medium changes the message.

And by that I mean the kind of stories that run in newspapers different than the kind of stories that

run on the evening news, which is different than the kind of stories that run on the internet.

Even though the world is the same, but we report it differently because of the medium.

Right.

That, um, it's not an accident that pop songs are 3.5 minutes long.

They're 3.5 minutes long because that's how long a 45 holes of music.

Right.

And so we came to understand that a pop song needs to be 3.5 minutes long because of the way Edison

invented the phonograph.

So if this medium of AI is showing up, how is it going to change the way we deliver messages?

Go look at the explore page of Midjourney and what you notice is, even though Midjourney is capable

of quite a few ways of expressing itself.

It all seems to be this near sci fi, robot lit soft --.

Yeah.

And because the medium encourages that, that doesn't mean it's going to stay like that.

But we should be aware of its biases.

We should be aware of what feels natural to it.

And so I'm hyper aware of that all the time.

And that's part of.

So what ChatGPT did was they exposed that Claude put a layer of friendliness on top of it that hid a

little bit of its humanity and its biases.

And I fell for it.

Right.

And happily, because I want to work with some thing person that's pleasant.

Um, so the long answer to your question, we need to think about what are people going to pay for,

because creators got to make money and they're not going to pay for pretty good nonfiction books anymore.

The value of those are going to go to zero.

They're not going to pay even with ads watching for sort of funny one minute videos.

Not going to pay for that.

They're definitely not going to pay for $200 million blockbuster movies that aren't very good, because

there's nothing in the new Superman thing that I couldn't make in Mid-journey in a minute and a half,

right?

And so we're going to have to figure out how is attention going to be adjudicated.

What is going to get made to fit into that attention hole?

Right.

So Google ads led to the whole direct to consumer nonsense.

Google ads led to a totally different kind of ecosystem of commerce, right?

Well, when Google ads go away, what comes out I mean, it's going to the medium is going to change

all of this.

Yeah.

What do you think if you had to bet what what do you think people will pay for if it's not going to

be the kind of middling nonfiction book or the Superman.

I think in the medium run, people are going to pay for community.

I think the loneliness epidemic is real and some people are going to pay.

I for a substitute for that, but most people can afford it, are going to find circles that are worth

being part of.

Yeah, but the value of scarce content is going to go.

It's going to plummet.

This is going to plummet to zero.

Mhm.

Mhm.

Okay.

Last question before the recipes.

What advice would you give people if their mid-late career who want to use AI thoughtfully.

And then also same question but for newer newer graduates.

Okay.

So this goes segues into the recipe thing.

I think, uh, you should begin by creating a series of documents in word or text.

Edit and describe your situation in as much detail as you can.

Go on for pages.

Write a five page autobiography.

Include your resume.

Make a different document with all of your health history.

Make another document with relationship history for for business or personal things you're dealing with.

And then because remember, you could never do this with a person.

When you're going to ask an LLM, a question, upload the thing.

No one's going to sit there and listen to you.

Read five pages of background when you ask them a question, but the LLM will.

And so then I would begin by saying here, here's who I am, here's what I do.

Here are my favorite projects.

Here's what lit me up.

Here's how I pay the bills.

What should I do now and go spend an hour talking to Claude about that?

And don't listen to people on podcasts.

Listen to Claude because it's read your five pages and I have not.

And that will Create this opportunity for you to be more mindful, and you don't have to do what it

says, but you have to agree or disagree.

And if you disagree, ask new questions, right.

But it's you know, when I think back of, you know, what got me into the book business?

Uh, the late Byron Price worked with me when I was in the software business, and he knew I was leaving

the company, and he said, oh, you should be a book packager.

You'd love it.

As soon as you quit and moved to New York, call me and I'll get you started.

And I did it.

I quit, and I moved to New York because one person said this was the job for me.

And then Byron ghosted me, and I never spoke to him again because he didn't answer any of my calls.

And now here I was, I was committed.

This is this is a lousy way to pick a career.

And it's so much easier now to not get a guarantee, but to understand the lay of the land, to understand

where the opportunities are.

You don't have to go be an entrepreneur, but if you are mindful about it, you will always do better

than if you're not.

Mhm.

Have you.

This is an aside but have you tried Claude code like Claude in the terminal.

Yeah that's next on the list.

But after my bad experience with the Twilio coding, I decided to do things I was good at instead.

So I've been using that, but like, not for coding, but like with markdown files, basically like

a knowledge management system.

But but basically what you're talking about where it's like you have a file and that's like the instructions

and that can point out to all the documents that you're talking about.

And it's pretty crazy.

It's like, it's very fun.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Um, okay.

So let's do the recipe part.

Um, do you have a kind of particular recipe or use case of I mean, you've shared a bunch, but if

there are any that are interesting or new or that feel like it'd be fun to share.

And if you can share screen or if you want to.

That'd be awesome too.

Yeah, I'm not going to share a screen, but I will say a couple of things first.

Okay.

The one I wish I had known about six months ago.

Great.

If you find yourself in a frustrating conversation or it's hallucinating or it's doing something that's

not helpful, shut the window and start a new one.

And as a human being, this feels really rude to me and inappropriate.

And I don't know why it works, but it's spectacular and I'll be like some of the work I've been doing

with Claude on these artifacts.

We'll keep going until I hit the limit.

Even though I'm on the fancy package, it runs out of Ram to keep it on its head.

And so I'll have to start a new one.

And sometimes the new one will be this eager beaver smart cooperative intern.

And sometimes it'll be this lazy jerk.

And it's the same program.

And what I've discovered.

I don't have to apologize.

I don't have to say bye.

I just close it.

start over and I've got all my docs.

I reload the docs and then we're off to the races.

So that's my biggest recipe hack between uploading the docs and starting over.

Yeah, the the third one is that I regularly ask, uh ChatGPT to help me write Midjourney prompts.

And I asked Claude to help me write ChatGPT prompts.

Interesting, because it will.

I can go back and forth with one LLM and say, well, no, no, that's going to.

And then and then we'll boil it down to a really good prompt and I'll paste it into the other one.

And I find that is less recursive than pasting it back into itself, because when I paste it back into

itself, it seems to have shortcuts in there that I didn't intend.

And so that's a big part of it.

And then, uh, the photo one, we already talked about uploading photos And then I guess the last one

is being loquacious about what I wanted to rhyme with.

So we were taught by Google to use as few words as possible because Google was supposed to be a miracle.

It would read your mind, right?

And so, you know, back when I was running Squidoo, if you typed laptop bags, two words, it would

take you to the Squidoo page on laptop bags, which was the perfect place to go.

And it was ten screens worth of links and prose about which kind of laptop bag.

But that's not a good way to talk to an LLM.

Instead, you can say things like memento is one of my favorite movies, but I also like, uh, the

production values of The Matrix and the sense of humor of, um, The Usual Suspects.

Please give me five movies I haven't seen yet.

And if you just say, give me five movies, who knows what you're going to get.

But if you give it these anchors.

And what I have found is that certain anchors set it up almost instantly.

If an anchor is Kevin Kelly or Seth Godin or Baratunde Thurston or Patti Smith, those are great anchors.

In just two words, you sort of know where it's going to go after that, right?

So you say, if I was asking Kevin Kelly for career advice based on my resume, what would he tell me

to do?

That's a really useful prompt.

What do you think makes for a good anchor?

Like what makes those names better than I think you need to have someone who has a significant body

of work it's able to read.

Yeah.

And who is distinctive enough that they could you could make a parody about them.

Right.

So there are plenty of people who have written Semi-funny movies, but Woody Allen is somebody that

instantly you can parody instantly remind you of somebody, right?

And so when you can find those sorts of voices, whether it's my friend Jill Greenberg, the photographer,

right.

If you say to Midjourney, in the style of Jill Greenberg, it knows exactly what to do.

Richard Avedon is the same way.

Did you actually do that prompt about the movies?

Yes, I've done it more than once.

I mean, those specific movies, I didn't do that one.

I did, um, I was looking for the right kind of, uh, vintage movie to watch with my wife.

And it recommended charade, a movie that I had never seen.

Um, and it's next in the queue, but the reviews look perfect.

I never would have picked it.

I asked because because Memento and Usual Suspects are like two of my favorite movies.

So.

Yeah.

Um, where do you think is a place that it keeps coming up short?

Like where is the place where it's just like.

And that you think maybe it'll never nail it?

Well, very clearly.

Good for me.

The place where it's coming up short, the most glaringly is it has no idea what to do next.

Hmm.

And I'm guessing that's the bias of the people who built it, but it's also a limitation on what it

can know.

This is part of why I think it's terrible at writing anything funny.

Yeah.

Because it knows how to do a one liner.

But if you ask it to write a Seinfeld script, it's useless.

It's absolutely useless.

That the hard work.

So what Larry and Jerry did is every year they would have new people in the writing room, and these

guys would come to the writers room with true stories from their life like the soup Nazi is a real person.

He was a friend of mine.

And friend of yours?

Yeah.

I didn't know they ruined Al's life.

They just ruined his life.

Really?

Yeah.

Dang.

That's sad.

But some guy in the writers room told the story, and the hard work was picking the good stories and

stringing them together.

So the stringing together part, the picking, the deciding we're going to do a deck of cards versus

doing this that's reserved for creators right now.

I don't know if that's always going to be true.

I think it's a surmountable problem.

The problem, the challenge will be there's going to be a period of time will be gray goo and crappy

stuff, and it needs to figure out good taste about figuring out what's next.

But, um, same thing is true for coding.

I think if you say to it, uh, build me an entire operating system that's better than the Mac, it

couldn't do that.

Yeah.

Um, and and so.

But in the long run, my thesis is that all of this is trivial compared to what's going to happen next.

That the internet is called the internet, and it has the same word in it twice inter and network.

It is about connection between and across people.

And for the longest time, everything that worked on the internet worked because it connected people

to each other or people to information they were looking for.

So what happens when Claude knows everything there is to know about me, and it knows everything there

is to know about you, and we opt in to let it be an intermediary between us and other people in our

circle.

So something as simple as I'm about to throw out a whole pile of something because it's useless and

it says, wait, wait, wait.

Alex was just looking for that on eBay right now.

There's a whole level of new intermediary magic that's happening because there's this sort of confidential

slush pile in between us, and it's sorting it out on our behalf to create new connections, new opportunities.

Someone's dealing with a problem.

Someone has the answer to that problem.

A connection is I mean, magic.

Magic happens that we believe is only supposed to be coincidental.

Right.

You're on an airplane and you discover the person sitting next to you is someone you've been wanting

to know your whole life.

Well, Claude already should know that.

So how does that start to perfect the human condition in ways that people can't even imagine right now?

Mm.

So that's the part you think is coming next that is going to make all this feel like trivia.

Is that, like, I think, infinite connection?

I don't think I want to say next.

I do think it's going to happen.

The thing that the thing that worries me in, in addition to all the other things that worry me, is,

uh.

Sam Altman has to pay back a lot of people.

A lot of money.

Yes.

And that always leads to organizations becoming evil the way Google did and watching Google become evil.

Shutting down companies like mine, um, doing things that they couldn't be possibly be proud of that.

That's sad.

And I think advertising will accelerate that.

So I'm hoping we can stay ad free, at least for people who can come up with $20 a month.

And I'm hoping that someone cares enough about leadership that they won't acidify the whole thing.

Mm.

That's a good place, I think, to do a quick speed round.

Okay.

So bring it on.

Speed round is quick.

Super quick answers whatever comes to mind first.

Um, and there's only five of these, and then we'll get you out of here.

Uh, okay.

How would you describe your relationship with AI?

Is it an assistant?

Is it a partner?

What?

What is that relationship?

It's a intern and an occasional thought partner.

Okay.

What do you wish I could do?

But it never will.

Thai massage.

Everyone's making predictions about AI.

Let's make a prediction about humans.

Where do you think humans will be in ten years?

Exhausted.

Slightly broken.

With glimmers of hope.

So, like we are right now, basically.

What question about AI and creativity do you not?

Do you think people are not asking enough?

How can this make my work harder?

Mm, I like that.

What do you wish people talked about more instead of AI?

Climate.

Beautiful.

Seth, this is amazing.

Seriously, I really enjoyed it.

You made my day.

It was super fun.

Totally.

This was awesome.

I really, really appreciate it.
