Kind: captions Language: en hey what's up my name is Daniel misler and I'm super excited to share with you a new AI project I've just created called fabric so the basic idea of fabric is to start with human problems ever since the beginning of 2023 we've had a million pieces of AI flying around we've had apps we have chat GPT we have mobile apps now we have voice applications and most of all we have a million different prompts and the question is how do we actually use all this stuff and then that's the challenge I had for myself in the beginning of last year so what I started doing was thinking from the top down from a human perspective what do I actually want to do with AI what what do I think other people should be doing with AI as well and what that did was brought me to a human focused approach to Ai and what that means is I'm thinking first what are we trying to do at a human level with technology and specifically Ai and how do we categorize that and sort of capture it so this is essentially me here I like to read I like to listen to things I like to watch things discuss them think these are my inputs and ultimately what I'm trying to do is become better at doing all these things but more importantly applying them into something that matters in my life which is making better decisions that's ultimately what I'm trying to do here at step five so consuming all this stuff at layer one gets me new ideas at Layer Two which allows me to update my model of the world at layer three which can update my algorithms for how I actually do specific tasks at layer 4 and ultimately result in better decision- making so this is ultimately what I'm trying to actually accomplish in my life using technology including AI so I'm starting with that as the focus the next next thing I did was start to think of everything in terms of challenges so once again we're at the human level here we're not doing tech for the sake of doing Tech we're not doing AI for the sake of doing AI we're thinking about what are we actually trying to do on a day-to-day basis in terms of problems we're trying to solve challenges we're trying to overcome and for me I've I've got a list here right so I don't talk to my friends enough okay let's let's say that's a problem which it is sometimes there's too much content I I don't have time to read or watch you know multiple super long form podcasts read super long essays especially if I can't tell right off the bat if they're really good or not so the these are all problems right even if the content is good I don't have time to get to it uh when I watch it I might not remember the stuff because I don't have the time to take the notes and come back to the notes and that sort of thing uh I can't watch all the bounties and the Scopes let's say I'm doing security testing I can't look at all the different programs I could possibly be testing I don't have time to go kickoff automation all the time I don't have to time to figure out what's in academic paper if someone sends me a contract do I have time to read it all the way through and look for the gotas these are all problems that I run into on a daily basis so I sort of think of those as my challenges then over here on the right I'm looking at how can I turn those into components right how do I turn those into discrete objects that I can then apply AI to and that brings us to the project itself which is called fabric as we talked about and it is on github.com Danel misler SL fabric got the logo here got the mission human flourishing via AI augmentation and it's an open source framework for augmenting humans using AI so so the first thing to talk about here is just the structure of it so the entire project is themed off of the concept of Fabrics or blankets or I don't know patterns that kind of thing so essentially you have the project itself which is called fabric the optional server that you could set up to run this thing independently yourself this is optional you don't have to do that but it's called a mill the patterns themselves the individual little blocks of AI that apply to specific problems those are called patterns and they're all otherwise known as prompts so you could just think of those as the prompts those are called patterns if you link multiple patterns together those are called stitches and looms are client side apps which you don't actually have to use anymore but they're there and they're all part of that naming structure okay going back into the top and navigating the files here we're going to go into patterns and this is where you see the core content of the project there's lots of stuff going on here you don't really need to worry about too much of it uh we're going to talk about installation a little bit later but this is the main content analyze claims this is like analyzing uh somebody making a claim online that so and so is true or so and so is not true this analyzes claims and gives you like supporting evidence and counter evidence analyze incidents this is for security analyze a paper this looks like at an academ paper and tells you how good it is analyze pros this will actually rate the quality of writing your own writing anyone's writing looking at a spiritual text checking an agreement to see if anyone's trying to screw you over cleaning up text if it's all it's got special characters in it or it's garbage or it's got like really weird delimiters create aphorisms create a logo create an NPC for a role playing game and if you go inside of any of these here what you see is a system prompt and this system prompt is the thing that matters this is the content of a pattern this is a markdown file and this markdown file defines exactly what the prompt does what the AI does to address this specific problem so this one is about extracting article wisdom so this is specifically for when you have an article it's a political article it's talking about a security thing or it's just some kind of human story whatever it is you want to know what the main ideas are you want to know what the main takeaways are the things you should pay attention to and so we have an identity and purpose where we tell the AI like who it is how to think of itself and what its mission is in this particular piece of AI then we tell it the steps to follow to actually do the AI task and then we tell it exactly how to Output and then the input comes behind it and that's what you're going to send in from the article and that results in the output which we're going to talk about when we go into examples but this is an example of one pattern and again we've got dozens in here and we just keep adding to them so those are the patterns okay so one more example of a pattern before we jump into actually using it and showing the examples dynamically this one is called analyze pros and it does a few things it looks at the novelty of something it looks at going down here the clarity of the writing and it also looks at the pros in the writing so it's it's essentially how clear is it how creative is it how like vibrant and interesting is the language and most importantly in my opinion at least is how surprising is the content how new are the ideas and you end up with three different scores that come out of this and we'll show this in an example here coming up soon the most important thing to think about though when you're looking at this when you're looking at any of these these are all open source I'm clicking back into the patterns these are all open source which means and this has already happened to me I put out most of these myself in the initial launch of the project and that was a couple weeks ago and people have already submitted new patterns updated patterns their own versions of the patterns and guess what they improved on what I had so I actually took their copy and swapped it over and it became the authoritative new one that just moved mine to the side because theirs was better and that's what's going to be so powerful about this project is that it's open source it's Dynamic and it benefits from everyone it it's it's a global project for augmenting people with AI Okay cool so now let's let's jump in and let's actually look at some examples so I've got this video here I have loved this video for a long time I think it came out in 20123 sometime sometime last year maybe towards the end I'm not sure but this is a 1 and a half hour video let let me just show you what they talk about in this thing it is absolutely insane so we've got over here we've got Ry I think this is a the poet which I haven't looked at the poems yet we've got philosophy creativity recession conspiracies how you structure your life creative process thinking clearly the Church of graphs painting drugs essay curiosity Consciousness this is brilliant stuff it's one of my favorite videos I've ever watched in my life and I actually have a keyboard shortcut just to be able to pull up this video URL and share it with other people it's uh it's amazing so the point is this thing is an hour and 24 minutes long it's got a million pieces of wisdom in there how often can you watch this video first of all do you even have an hour and a half to go and watch the video in the first place a lot of people don't I don't have time to go and watch this thing 20 times I don't have time to watch 30 or 20 or 50 of these a week so look what I could do I copy the video URL I'm going to jump over to my shell and then I could do this so I can run this command uh PT this actually just pulls the transcript pull text it pulls the transcript and here's what it does by itself so that just pulled the transcript and if you look at this thing uh word count with words I think it's like 16,000 words yeah 16, 468 words that's that's a lot of content well I want to know this is the origin story for this first pattern I'm going to show you the pattern is called extract wisdom I think we might have seen it scrolling by when we were looking at the patterns earlier so this thing you run like this fabric we're going to do streaming we're going to do pattern and extract wisdom and what's cool about this is I created it so that it would emulate what I would do if I were to manually take notes I love the idea of manually taking notes watching slow pausing slow it down go back think about it take some more notes so I'm trying to emulate that process and if a video is an hour and a half long it's going to take at least that long to take long detailed notes so I I wanted to emulate that with AI and that is one of the first patterns that I created for fabric so check this out it is now pulling the content again it is now sending it into Fabric and watch what it does gives me a summary first okay pretty cool intro sentence here ideas the West is perceived as dying due due to a culture that celebrates mediocrity and suppresses individual greatness ry's poetry look at this this this is gold here absolute gold then it goes into not just the ideas which are the most important but then it goes into quotes and this could have come from either side of the conversation anybody who is participating in the conversation then it goes into their habits what what types of things do they do because I'm looking for opportunities to improve my life going back to the first thing we talked about so if I find out that I I run this against a hundred different things and I find out that they all wake up and get sun in their eyes which probably I got from running extract wisdom on a huberman video but anyway if those add up enough then they become something that I would update my routine with then it goes into facts so these are like thirdparty verifiable facts that maybe I didn't know about but they just happen to mention and I find interesting then look at this references references right so this is where I found out about this poetry this is where I found out about um a number of things in here in fact another video that I did this on my other favorite which I also have a keyboard shortcut for is a ner oxman and she mentioned Victor frankl's a man search for meaning and that book changed my life and I got it because of this AI because of fabric being able to pull interesting references out so anytime somebody in the conversation says oh yeah you you read that or you saw that piece of art or whatever that is something that gets mentioned here it gets extracted then finally it ends up with recommendations so that can go directly into you know an update for your model of the world or an update for an algorithm for how to do a specific thing I actually have a very specific example for this which is brushing your teeth at night versus in the morning huberman just did a brand new episode very recently on oral health and uh yeah it it's one of the things that's going to update my current methodology so back on that other slide where it's like I have a methodology for doing a thing I parse wisdom I find out something new I update I'm now a better person as a result of that I think that is fascinating and super interesting so that's one that is called extract wisdom let's look at another one okay here's another example of a pattern this one is called write essay this is a little piece of notes these are nothing but just like little bullets essentially I don't have the actual bullet next to it but it's essentially a set of random thoughts um I wanted to write an essay about this thing so I actually laid it out a little bit but they're not like 100% complete sentences it's not like a perfect essay it's not even an essay yet it's really just a list of sentences but watch this I'm going to Gra gra this I'm going to copy that it's now in the clipboard I'm going to do p which I have Alias to PB paste so I'm pasting out of the clipboard and I'm going to put that into fabric switch SP write essay and look at this and this thing specifically the way this pattern works is it emulates the clarity and Brilliance and simplicity and lack of grandiosity of Paul Graham's writing style now I don't recommend that you go and create a whole bunch of essays writing like Paul Graham because that would be kind of bad and gross but it is a good way to like tell you how to write a good essay uh and it could give you lots of ideas but ideally what you would want to do is create your own pattern and give it examples of your own writing now if you look at the content here okay I I wrote the notes I know what the essay is supposed to look like so I'm reading these passages here modic learning sits at the intersection of algorithmic and osmotic learning it involves adjusting our life's operating system our core beliefs and assumptions about how the world works that's exactly what it is I mean that's exactly I mean it's very similar to how like Paul Graham might have written this passage I mean every one of these passages is like very clear it it's it's absolutely capturing the content of the notes okay so let Let's uh let's take that let's go and let me show you something else this is insane so the S actually stands for streaming which means it's returning you saw it's scrolling across it's actually returning the result as the AI is returning it and pushing it back to us it's printing it on the screen I'm going to remove that so that I can create a stitch so here's a stitch I'm going to send this thing to tweet and this is actually just a an alias I've already Alias to the fabric command so don't worry about the fact that I didn't type fabric it's all still fabric so now I'm going to send this it's the same stuff in the clipboard which is the notes I'm going to send it to write an an essay and then I'm going to send it to write a tweet about that content and now this is going up and doing its thing okay so check out this result here um learning isn't just about the facts it's a complex stance between understanding in application especially in web testing I had a thing in the notes about doing web testing and then it gives us some bullets here and the bullets are decorated with specific emojis so algorithmic modic and effective Learners basically combine them so that is a pretty cool tweet and then you would just put the URL for for the essay that you're going to point to or the video you're going to point to Boom so you got a tweet so the most important thing here to look at is this here okay this pipe symbol we every single one of these patterns and fabric itself is designed to be piped in and out of so you can actually take the output of any one of these and send it to the the input of any other one of them and if you look at all the different patterns that you have I'm going to go into the patterns directory look at all these explain code explain documents extract the proof of concept extract sponsors from a video improve a prompt you can actually send a prompt into here and it'll give you a better prompt label and rate let's talk about that one next so check this out so we have the content I'm actually okay this is cool so so we have this essay being written right we have the stuff in the clipboard still I don't think we've overwritten that so here's what we're going to do we're going to take this essay output and we're going to send it to label and rate and this again this is a fabric Alias uh these going to install when you install fabric so you can actually just run label and rate more like a regular CLI command so now we're going to rate the quality of the essay that it wrote so I've never done this before we're going to see what it does okay and now we have content coming back so we got a one- sentence summary and again this thing is going to rate um it's going to label the content it's also going to rate it okay we got an A tier rating so this is based on video game ratings so s tier is like the absolute best a tier means that it is something that you should consume within the month because it's really really good and it also gives the reasons why it's rating these things at this level and then it actually gives us a score a quality score look at this 85 quality score that's very very high so to be clear this thing just took my notes it wrote an essay and it rated it very high and I have tuned this thing for a very long time so it's pretty hard to actually get an 85 so I'm impressed that it actually wrote an essay that scores that High um hopefully I would like to think that it was because the ideas and the notes were actually rated that high okay let's actually do something different I didn't plan on doing this let's actually just take the content of the note itself so I take this and I'm going to send that into label and rate by itself and see if it different than the full essay a tier okay interesting so I got the same a tier and and I got it the same oh interesting and it gave the same score that is really fascinating yeah there's another pattern I could use to actually assess Pros because there's actually no really good Pros in it it's just a set of like bullets or notes ideas for an actual essay but really interesting that the ideas rated just as high which you would expect that to be the case because the ideas should exist in both the notes form and the essay form anyway on to the next pattern okay for this next pattern I'm actually going to show it in the version of a slide because I've actually got a screenshot here it's pretty cool so this is a local role playing game that I do with a bunch of friends uh here in my hometown and this is actually an a real picture of one of the setups the uh GM Chad Lynch does amazing work obviously and uh what we do is I record each session with this little microphone right here into voice memos within the Apple ecosystem I then export that I run AI against it to extract it it's a whisper that runs against it and look what I can create with that so this is an example this is a great example of we're not doing AI for the sake of AI we're doing doing AI to enhance human activities okay this is us getting together this is a physical environment it's us four or five people playing we've got a real table with real Miniatures on it that were painted by a real person and we're having fun together for three or four hours every Friday that is a vastly incredibly amazingly Human Experience and what we're doing with AI is not trying to replace that we're trying to enhance that so what I'm doing is I'm recording this look at this over here on the left look key events this it extracted all the cool stuff that we did in the session it lays out exactly what we did in an ordered way it actually even extracts the cool funny stuff that we said during it I mean this is amazing for remembering what we've done looking back having memories to share with each other it's just unbelievable then to make it even cooler check this out previously on Crown and Mayhem amidst the Miss shrouded peaks of Highlands turmoil engulfed the odow so you hear the vibe there and that was an AI voice from 11 Labs reading this setup for the next episode this is a thing they used to do in old TV shows they would actually set up the current episode that's about to come on by reminding you of what happened in the last episode so they always start with previously on so that's exactly what we set up here so once again that just brings a smile to everyone's face it's all AI but it's extracting the the meaning the interesting part of what we've done and it's just enhancing it it's put a little spice on it and this is what I love about the fabric project but in general my approach to AI is to take and magnify the human elements of of what we're doing in life right we have human problem problems let's solve it with AI we have human things that we enjoy let's enhance them with AI right let's not think about how to replace things let's focus human first supported by Tech supported by Ai and that's the way we think about it okay I want to talk real quick about how to install fabric it's pretty simple you go to the quick start link which is right here you download the installer uh basically the repo you download the repo go inside the repo you install poetry with this curl command you make your setup file executable you run the setup it basically installs all the dependencies and everything for you then you run fabric setup and that installs your key from open aai and then you can run fabric help and you will see this help menu here and then you are fully installed all right that was a quick overview of fabric and we are really excited about it we are really excited to have people go and play with it download it install it play with the patterns upload their own patterns can't wait to see what you do with it and uh I hope this philosophy does rub off on people that basically AI should not be considered a replacement for Humanity it is an augmentation it is an enhancement it is something that makes Humanity better and a lot of people won't see it that way and they'll take it in another Direction but we don't have to accept that and so our approach here with fabric is to very much think human first and we encourage you to do the same and we can't wait to see what you do with the project so thanks for listening and uh there'll be a lot more videos coming out soon with more and more use cases more and more patterns and we'll see you in the next one take care
