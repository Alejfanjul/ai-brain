It's worth taking a moment to talk about how an AI and LLM actually works, what it really knows, and

then we can talk about data.

So that course I took back at Stanford in 1983, Doug Leonhardt believed at the time, very controversially,

that if you fed a computer enough ridiculously simple statements like a table is a flat surface with

legs that people put something on.

If you gave it millions and millions and millions of those statements, something like consciousness

would arise.

Doug was way ahead of its time, but that's sort of what happened.

We built the internet so that we could train llms on trillions of bits of information.

The thing is, an AI doesn't know anything.

It's just doing math.

It's putting on a party trick.

It is.

It has read everything and it knows what words follow?

What other words?

So when you ask a question, it does math on that question and looks at the words you asked.

It doesn't understand anything any more than the sun understands you're having a picnic tomorrow.

It just rises, but it doesn't know what it's doing.

This is all based on data.

It has an insatiable need for data.

It doesn't understand your private conversations.

It's not stealing the writing of a great author.

It's looking at the math behind the words.

This is why it can hallucinate.

Because we all hallucinate.

We're all just making stuff up.

But the difference is, it is just making a math mistake and then doubling down on that math mistake.

The math mistake is caused by having all of this data that's slightly randomized, and then having to

make a choice about which direction to head.

What this means for us as people who use it, is that we have to be aware of what Dan Dennett calls

the intentional stance.

He was my philosophy professor when I was in college, and he ended up becoming really well known in

philosophy circles.

The intentional stance says we evolved to do something really useful and convenient.

And what it is is to imagine that other people and other things have a voice in their head, like we

have a voice in our head.

So when you see a dog do something and you say he's doing that because he wants X, or because he thinks

I'm going to do Y, no, he's just doing that because the electrons in his brain lined up in a certain

way that created chemical reactions that got them to do that.

There is no want.

There is no believe.

There is no imagine because it's just wet electronics up in the brain.

And it's even more clear when you think about how we interact with a simple calculator or computer.

Oh, it doesn't like what you did.

Try this instead.

There's no liking.

We're just imagining this because it makes it easier to navigate the world.

And so when we think about AI.

AI is simply doing math on data.

What we know is this AI can transform the data it gives you.

And when you have data, you transform the world around you.

So some examples I uploaded a 40 page business plan that had been written by six different people over

the course of six months.

It was complicated and convoluted.

It was 40 pages long.

I uploaded it to Claude and I said, please review this.

Look for contradictions and statements that aren't true or redundant.

And it wrote me a page and a half long memo that would have gotten you an A at Harvard Business School.

This is really useful because now I can use that to rewrite the business plan, or have it rewrite the

business plan to make it something that is more actionable.

Let's think about the million real estate brokers in the United States, what exactly do they do?

Because they're not the world's best salespeople.

Maybe a few of them are, but not in general.

People tend to buy houses.

They don't have them sold to them.

And as we're seeing sites like Zillow can find all of the data, it's all been written down and come

up with insights that people can use.

What real estate brokers do is adjudicate status roles.

What they do is do a dance around tension and about possibility.

And what they do is arbitrage data.

Well, if you're not using an AI to help you do that on a regular basis, you are falling behind that

a truck driver gets into their truck and uses Waze or Google Maps to get from here to there, because

making the right choice about how to get from here to there is the single most profitable decision they're

going to make today.

Well, what happens when I multiply that by 100 or 1000?

What happens if I multiply that?

Because in I knows where all the trucks are all the time?

Because in I knows which truck is about to head somewhere empty, because in I knows which kind of truck

is a more efficient way to get something from here to there.

When we change the data, we change the outcome.

So we have to begin by coming back to what's it for?

The library.

I was hanging out with a well-known, uh, head of a library, and he was talking about their future.

It's worth noting that, uh, 15 years ago, 35% of all the books taken out of the libraries in the

United States were not books.

35% were DVDs.

A third of their traffic.

Now, as you know, that's getting close to zero.

So what should they do?

Should they figure out ways to create e-book accounts so everyone in town can read all the ebooks they

want for free or audios.

I think that's fine, but that's not library work.

That's what the government ought to be doing.

I'm in favor.

The library can become something different now that the data is no longer hidden on inaccessible shelves.

The data is right there in front of all of us.

What the library needs to do, what they can do, is show up to change our attitude, to create human

connection.

And then when we have those two things, give us access to the data that will change how we see the

world.

Whatever it is you're doing for a living, if you're a third grade teacher, if you're somebody who's

marketing eyeglasses, we need to keep coming back to who's it for and what's it for?

Why do we even do this work?

Where is the data?

The data about where something is, how much something costs, whether something is the right thing

for us or not.

How we will teach people from A to B.

What's it for?

Who's it for?

AI is going to change all of those things.
