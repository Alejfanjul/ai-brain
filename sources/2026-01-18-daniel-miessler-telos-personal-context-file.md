## Conteúdo

This page is a subset of my personal TELOS file, showing my problems, missions, goals, strategies, and a few other TELOS components.

## Problems

In line with this essay, these are what I view as the most important problems in the world.

In addition to what's here, the top-level navigation for this site is basically a breakout of other sections of my TELOS file as well.

| PID | Problem |
|-----|---------|
| P0 | **Only a tiny fraction of humanity's creative potential is activated on Earth.** Most people don't believe they have valuable contributions to make. They think there are "special" people—and they aren't one of them. They've never asked who they are, what they're about, and have never articulated or written it down. This makes them catastrophically vulnerable to AI displacement. Without activation, there is no high-agency. |
| P1 | **The Hierarchical Mindset** — People are stuck in a 1950's worldview where there are "idea people" and "worker people." This false frame prevents activation. |
| P2 | **Broken World Models** — People have poor models of how the world works, and they lack the tools to properly improve them. |
| P3 | **Type 3 Creativity Restraint** — We have no idea what we are capable of because we're limited by never having seen what's possible. |
| P4 | **Corporate Opacity Crisis** — Companies are not prepared for the post-AI world because they are siloed, opaque, and have never done a Telos assessment on themselves. They can't articulate what work is being done, why their workforce is worth the cost, or how anything contributes to outcomes. |

## Strategies (Solutions to Problems)

| SID | Strategy |
|-----|----------|
| S0 | **Human 3.0** — Our approach to P0. A framework for helping people ask the fundamental questions, articulate who they are, write it down, share it, and work on problems that matter to them. H3 is the activation protocol. |
| S4 | **Corporate 3.0 (C3)** — Our approach to P4. Human 3.0 applied to organizations. Full Telos assessment, transparency mapping, AI-readiness evaluation, and transition roadmap for companies. |

## Missions

M2 is critical but not time-sensitive.

| MID | Mission |
|-----|---------|
| M0 | Increase human Eudaimonia by helping people identify, articulate, and pursue their own purpose in life. |
| M1 | Build systems—heavily leveraging the latest in AI—that help people upgrade to the best possible version of themselves (Human 3.0). |
| M2 | Transfer (or store) my and B's minds into a format that we can upload into the next (digital) version of our lives. |

## Notes

This feels very strange to put on the internet, because of how intimate it is. But... 1) it's not the whole file, and 2) it's worth it if it gets other people to do something similar.
