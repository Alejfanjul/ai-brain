The third pillar of fulfilling leadership

---Art of Accomplishment --- Hi Alejandro,  A few years ago, I worked with the CEO of a fast-growing company. He was deeplycommitted to his people: Generous with equity, flexible on hours, always available.  But his company had a problem. **They couldn't kill anything.**  Every initiative seemed to live forever. Their roadmap was cluttered with half-finished projects. Teams were stretched thin, saying yes to everything and finishing nothing.  He kept trying to fix it with reorgs, new prioritization frameworks, or hiring new leaders. But nothing seemed to work.  One day I asked him: "When's the last time you said no to something outside of your professional life?"  He went quiet.  As we talked, a pattern emerged. He had a **deep discomfort with disappointing** people. He'd say yes to dinners he didn't want to attend, to favors that drained him, and to projects that didn't align, because someone was excited about them.  **His inability to disappoint had become the company's inability to prioritize.**  That quarter, we worked on his relationship with the word no.  As he got more comfortable with it, something shifted. He started ending initiatives cleanly. His leadership team followed.  Within six months, the company had cut 40% of its active projects, and revenue per employee had jumped. Pillar Three: **Your team mirrors your inner landscape**  I see this pattern **play out constantly i**n companies: What the leader avoids personally doesn’t go away. It becomes institutional.  Their self-talk determines how their team communicates. Their boundaries (or lack thereof) become their team's policies. Every place they have a trigger or blind-spot, an oppositional force will grow in their organization.  Every leader's consciousness is **reflected in their team.** This can be uncomfortable to accept, because it means the dysfunction you see out there is connected to something in here. But it's also powerful. Because it means that when you shift your inner world, your team follows.  This is a **key pillar** of the leadership work we do at the Council. And why we go beyond strategy or management techniques. It's about doing the inner work that makes outer change possible.    --- **Experiment**  This week, pick one frustration you have with your team.  Maybe they're not taking enough ownership. Maybe communication is sloppy. Maybe there's a lack of urgency.  Then ask yourself: *How does this pattern stem from my behavior?* |    The Council We're excited to be **opening up official applications this Monday, February 16th.** We've had a lot of interest come in already, and we will be carefully reviewing all submissions.
