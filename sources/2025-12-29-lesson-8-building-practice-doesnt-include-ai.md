Hey, girl.

Hi.

Hi, Molly.

I want to believe that I can not use AI in my business.

The way I took your AI was I did not use social media, and it's been a blessing.

I know they're not the same, but am I naive to believe that it's possible to have a business going

forward without using AI directly?

Me or Llms?

Okay, so we're shifting topics here, which is fine.

Let me just shift my brain into a new gear.

Okay.

Um, the reason you don't want to use it is it's similar to why you don't want to use electricity.

Or what's the challenge with you using AI?

Um, I haven't, I would if I had the money to hire somebody else to use it.

I would do that.

I would love to hire a virtual assistant and someone who loves it to use it, but I don't have the money

to do that yet.

So I'm just I'm just hearing a lot that I need to that I, that I would have better traction and and

I don't know if that's true.

Try this again.

Let's try let's get this a different way.

You don't want to use AI because you're afraid of it.

It makes you sick.

What's the problem?

I enjoy the process.

I don't I don't see the need for it yet.

Okay.

And what kind of work is it that you don't see the need for it to help you with, um, coaching and

teaching?

I okay, I'm already.

I'm.

I'm already seeing.

In fact, I'm already seeing my students.

Um, I think I'm being trained.

I think I'm very quickly being replaced by it.

Mhm.

Not exactly, but very quickly happening to me already.

Very unsettling.

So yeah.

You would like to hone your craft as a coach, as a small group teacher.

And you feel the system throwing slime all over your future and just making you a cog in a system and

then discarding you, and you want to go in the other direction and lean into the humanity that you

can bring that it will never be able to do.

Is that what what I'm hearing?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Terrific.

Um, you know, every post I've ever written, in every book I've ever written, I wrote every word.

And I've never used AI or an assistant to do the writing.

Does that cost me?

Yes it does.

Does it benefit me?

Yes it does.

So the question you need to ask yourself is not, uh, how do I keep doing what I'm doing without AI?

It's.

How do I do something that I will never or is unlikely to want to do, be able to do soon?

And.

That means you're going to have to change how you coach and teach in a way that there's obviously no

substitute.

And so what kind of people are you teaching?

How old are they?

What do they do?

I'm helping them with their English.

They're mostly middle aged.

They're people who are.

I don't want to go on for too long.

I'm a little bit star struck and nervous, but it's okay.

I get the idea that that's enough.

If you're someone who doesn't speak English, you probably are insecure about the fact that you're in

a place where you're not speaking the language.

Your status is at risk.

And I'm just guessing here.

It's probable you're not in the top tier of income.

And given those two conditions, Duolingo is a great solution.

Duolingo is way cheaper than Molly.

Duolingo is way more private than Molly.

Duolingo gives me a chance to make mistakes and make mistakes and make mistakes without embarrassing

myself in front of another person, and we need to have the empathy to say to that person, you are

right, and given who you are and what you believe and what you want, you are doing exactly the right

thing.

Okay, but and there are other people who need the human equivalent of a hug and the support and everything

else that gives them the confidence to go learn English a different way.

But you have to begin by saying it's for almost no one.

Am I the right teacher?

But for the people who I am, the right teacher, I'm exactly the right teacher.

So maybe the solution?

I can think of a few.

One is you do all of your teaching walking outside with people.

Not on zoom, not in an airless classroom.

But we go for a walk in Central Park, and that's why it costs $50 an hour, because $50 later you will

have felt better about yourself.

You've had this magical walk, and when you look at Duolingo, it just feels like a can of fish compared

to this magical thing of I got to go for a walk with Molly.

You're idiosyncratic and you're specific Pacific or another one off the top of my head is Duolingo.

Can't offer me what a group class can offer me, and a group class gets back to this idea of being an

impresario, because the impresario says, I've invited four people who are in the same field to come

together every Tuesday at 1 p.m..

I invited you, and if you don't come, you're going to be missing out on what's happening right here.

And you can then use that class for that setting to create a remarkable experience that people want

to talk about.

Not because you're faster than Duolingo because it's unlikely you are, but because you gave them something

that they seek that overcomes their fear of sounding dumb.

Does that make sense?

So yeah, there's all these opportunities in front of you, but you're going to have to go outside of

your comfort zone by a lot to not just be another coach.

Thank you so much.

Thanks, Molly.

Thank you Molly.
