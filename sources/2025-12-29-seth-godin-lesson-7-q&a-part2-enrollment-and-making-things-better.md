I'm encountering something that seems quite problematic as a teacher of English as a second language.

I wonder what you think about this.

Some students use LMS a lot, both for work and for their learning.

I'm already starting to see some of them starting to lose confidence in their abilities.

They don't realize it is happening and sometimes even then, the damage has already been done.

This is a real problem because to speak another language or to get a job requiring English, a certain

amount of confidence is necessary.

When students start to lose confidence, they will refrain from when speaking, which will make the

problem worse.

It becomes a vicious circle.

I'm sure this happens in other fields as well.

Um, so I wonder what you would suggest for those who lack confidence in an area they seek mastery in,

and how I should be used effectively by such a person?

Thanks, Molly.

I experienced the same thing.

I was interacting with some people online from Eastern Europe, and I was astonished at how good their

English was in chat.

Well, it turns out that using Google Translate and other tools as a crutch made it so they could accommodate

the fact that I didn't speak their language by showing up perfectly in my language.

But if you use anything as a crutch for long enough, you don't develop your own skills.

So what to do about it?

Well, my approach is to try to imagine that it's 100 years ago and I already existed.

It's 100 years ago, and you are starting to build a English as a second language institution.

What would you do then if we didn't have the existing structure?

Well, I imagine that what you could do is use AI as a gymnasium, that we could challenge the students

not to wait their turn in class.

Because if you're in an English as a second language class with 20 people, you might get to talk for

2 or 3 minutes.

But to spend a full hour talking back and forth with an AI eye.

That what we will soon have is an eye that can understand what I'm saying in the language I'm trying

to learn.

So it will speak to me in Esperanto, and I will speak back to it in Esperanto.

And if I don't do well, it will correct me without the shame, without the fear that might come from

interacting with a human.

So when we see it as a tool, it's not a threat.

It's something that amplifies our ability to do the thing we seek to learn.

But at the core is enrollment.

If the student doesn't want to do this work, it's never going to happen.

Getting people to emotionally sign up for the kind of interactions that we can offer them, that is

going to become the hard work.

The same way when Wikipedia showed up with so much human knowledge in one place, many people, many

students chose not to learn it even though they had access.

So we sell people emotionally on where they can go, on how they will feel to lose an accent, to be

fluent, to do that generous work of helping someone who doesn't speak the language by speaking their

language.

When we sell them on this and then the AI tools are present, they won't want a shortcut.

I'll end the riff by pointing out that sometimes at the gym, you see people on the StairMaster holding

themselves up so they can get a higher score on the dashboard.

Not getting fit, just beating the metric.

We can do better than that.

We can create the conditions where people lean into where they want to go, and AI amplifies that.

Thanks, Molly.

Hi, Seth.

I have spent the last couple of months really leaning into AI, so experimenting with different tools,

learning different ways to integrate AI into creative work and trying to figure out how I can shape

my work in creative direction and user experience.

Because I, and I assume a lot of other creatives don't want to use AI just to churn out more work faster

and cheaper.

I want to use it to make my existing creative work stronger.

I would like to know where you think that I can make truly great creative stronger, not just cheaper

and faster.

And I assume that all of us as creatives are getting something dead wrong.

We're missing something here about how to add AI into our work and make ourselves indispensable in the

age of AI.

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks.

Thank you.

Jennifer.

So I've got two things to say in response to yours.

They're both about the phrase that's not very good.

The first part of it is this when a freelancer seeks to increase their productivity and efficiency,

what we do is we find the low hanging fruit.

We find the stuff the client doesn't care about because it's a commodity anyway.

And so if you're writing an essay, yeah, put it in a word processor because you don't get any points

whatsoever for typing it.

You've outsourced a task to make it more efficient.

AI is awfully good at that, but you're correctly pointing out that's not going to make us better.

It might make us competitive, it might make us a little bit cheaper, but it's not going to make us

better.

So the two things are about dancing with.

That's not very good yet.

And this is how freelancers grow.

This is how artists get better.

This is how someone who shows up at Juilliard when they're four years old playing the violin, leaves

15 years later.

So much better than when they got there.

The first method is this to find these tools, some of which I've used in making this workshop before.

They are perfectly polished and dancing with them.

So as we saw in that Q&A with Molly, that took me seven minutes.

It's inconceivable to me that it won't be dramatically better, easier and cheaper in a year.

Of course it will.

The ability to turn text into speech and speech into lip sync video is going to keep getting better

and better until we won't be able to tell it apart.

But the people who start using it now, when it's not that good, are going to figure out how to use

it better in the future.

So what we need to begin with is looking at ways to incorporate this dance partner that we are calling

AI into our work, and then adding that level of refinement after it has done the the work of building

the skeleton around it.

Rembrandt had plenty of people helping him with the paintings, but I'm pretty sure every painting that

went out the door Rembrandt looked at and probably improved before it left.

Jeff Koons, in our modern day, has hundreds and hundreds of people working on his art.

His art is only possible because he figured out how to bring the assets and the organization to his

work in ways that other artists were afraid to do.

So.

So when we lean in to using this assistant and pushing it to do things, it's not that good at yet,

and then adding the polish that our client or the audience wants.

We grow as creators.

And the second one, which sort of flips it Flipped it backwards is how often are you sharing your work

with Claude or ChatGPT and saying, this is my work and this this is the work of a competitor or someone

who came before me, or a hero of mine.

This is what I aspire to be.

Please give me constructive feedback.

Tell me what I'm missing.

Edit my work.

Push back again and again and again.

What I have found is I can get really hung up when I ask a human being for that sort of feedback.

I instinctually become defensive.

It doesn't make any sense to be defensive with a computer that's doing a math problem.

They're not judging you, they're just doing math.

So if you can say, here's a blog post I just wrote, compare this to my best blog posts.

What am I missing?

You will learn an enormous amount.

This is part of the path to it's not good enough yet.

And so when those two pieces fit together.

What we get is a chance to create the conditions for our work to accelerate.

If I was a jazz musician, I'd be challenging some music.

I to play with me and to push me to new frontiers.

If I was a writer, I'd be doing the same thing with my writing and photography and down the list.

If you're not doing it, please don't for a minute think that your competitors aren't doing it.

And yes, you do have competitors.

The audience has a choice.

The clients has a choice.

The client has a choice.

So what we get, we get.

We don't have to.

We get the opportunity to show up with this dancing partner.

We're early and we can dance.

And when we dance, we're going to learn how to dance better and in the end, create more value.

And that, in the essence of our work, is what we're trying to do.

If you create enough value, everything else takes care of itself.

Thanks.
