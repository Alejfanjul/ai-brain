Value creation.



It turns out that value creation is where productivity lives.



What is productivity?



Productivity is how much value do we create for a given amount of effort?



So Henry Ford made factory workers incredibly productive.



He made it so that in one day, a typical factory worker could produce far more value than a factory



worker at any other factory in Detroit.



That's how he was able to give the workers.



He hired a ten x rays.



They went from making $0.50 a day to $5 a day.



He didn't do it because he was a good guy.



He wasn't a good guy.



He did it because he knew that if he could pay these people a lot, they would still make him more money,



and he would cripple his competition because they couldn't keep up with him.



The thing is that the value that they produced was for the consumer.



They were able to make a better car, a faster car, a cheaper car, and they could do it more quickly



because of the machines that were available to them.



So when we look at AI, the simple thing to do is say, how can I make my tasks faster?



The simple thing to do is to say, how is this just like what I've been doing, but a little augmented?



But the useful thing to do is to ask, how does this create value for my customers?



How does this create value for the people that I'm here to serve?



And as we're going to see and we explore this, AI can create enormous amounts of value, not just race



to the bottom.



Because the thing is, as Amazon adds more robots, the best they're going to be able to do is replace



the cost of paying their warehouse workers.



That's a race to the bottom.



They'll get to keep that money, but it's a race to the bottom.



But if you can unlock more and more value for people, that's a race to the top.



It's not about scarcity.



It's about abundance.



It's about how do I show up with these tools to solve new problems, to fight old problems that have



been recalcitrant, find ways to shine new light on those problems.



This leads to the idea of being an impresario.



And I have a workshop about this, an impresario going back to the idea of Italy in 14 and 1500s.



Someone who rents the hall, hires the opera singers, sells the tickets, puts on the event.



The impresario created something that wasn't there before they got there.



And the thing is, when I started yoga Dean, one of the very first internet companies, we hit the



wall after a few months and I had to go out and raise millions and millions of dollars from Fred Wilson



and Jerry Colonna, or it wasn't going to work.



At our peak, we had almost 100 employees.



Today I could build that same organization with three people.



It's not because the people weren't important.



The people were really important, but the ones who were the most important were the ones who were showing



up to put on a show.



They weren't the ones who were doing tasks, because now I have a machine that can do the tasks, that



can do the programming, that can do various sorts of data acquisition, that can help me understand



how things fit together.



But still, someone needs to say, here we go.



Someone needs to say one, two, three start.



Someone needs to say, I'm going to create tension by showing up and looking at a system that people



haven't looked at before.



So I'm going to give you a super simple impresario example.



Years ago, AOL was my biggest customer.



AOL is the old people here.



No was the precursor to the internet.



AOL had a conference.



Ted and Steve invited their 50 or 100 biggest partners to come to Virginia, because they were going



to put on an event where they were going to tell us all about the exciting things they were doing.



Well, Tom was there.



He ran one of the other partners that AOL had.



Tom sent a note to 15 of us and he said, hey, I rented a suite here at the hotel.



Why don't you come by my place after the event today?



So, I don't know.



A dozen of us showed up and Tom said, here's my contract with AOL, put yours on the table, and everybody



put their contracts on the table.



And we looked at who had each paragraph, paragraph by paragraph, the best deal that gave us ammunition



because we weren't competing with each other.



Our competition was the business development department at AOL.



And if we go to them and say, hey, my deal isn't as good here or isn't as good here and good here,



all of us got a better deal the next time around because we had information.



None of this wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been for Tom.



If it hadn't been for Tom calling the meeting.



And when we think about AI and we think small, we say, oh, I'm threatened.



It's going to take away my job.



But when we think generative, we get to say, oh, I can call a meeting.



I can put on a show.



I can say, go.



I can use this information to serve my partners, to create value.



That is the fundamental mind shift.



Fans of mine know I've been saying these things for 20 plus years.



It just turns out that we are now in perhaps the final inflection point, the final fork in the road



where people are going to pick which way are they going?



Are you going to be an impresario, a leader, an inventor, a creator of value, or are you going to



work for an AI?



Because the problem with working for an AI is it doesn't respect you enough, and it doesn't pay you



enough, and it doesn't honor your effort.



So, as you know, AI makes mistakes.



People make mistakes too.



But AI does it in an amusing and fascinating way.



You should never trust an AI to do something that's important without you checking.



And what we're going to see going forward is what we've been seeing for the last 20 years.



What matters a lot is trust and curation.



Curation is editing is discerning.



It's choosing between the good stuff and the mediocre stuff.



Just because an AI made it doesn't mean it's bad, and it doesn't mean it's good.



Just because an author sent you a manuscript doesn't mean that the book is worth reading.



That what we get is the chance to say no and the chance to say hell yes.



As Derek Sivers would say.



What we get is the chance to curate what's coming out of these systems and then building, earning,



amplifying trust, not burning it because big companies burn trust all the time.



Big companies are just turning the dials, trying to become a monopoly, and they don't care who they



bother or who they alienate.



But you have a different opportunity here.



And that opportunity is to be able to say, here, I made this and have this, whatever this is, be



worth it.



When we learn to curate and we earn trust, now we have an asset.



And the thing about assets in the digital age is the more we use them, the better they get.Minhas Anotações
