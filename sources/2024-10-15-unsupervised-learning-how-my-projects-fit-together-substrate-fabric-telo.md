Kind: captions Language: en all right welcome to ins supervised learning this is Daniel misler and this is a big episode I've been wanting to do this for a number of months now and I finally got all the pieces together to be able to do it so let's jump in okay so this is a post called how my projects fit together it is a follow-up to a previous post called what I'm doing and how it's going and I think that came out about a year ago something like that but what this post does is it essentially answers the question that I get asked most often which is people looking at the various projects that I put out over the last year and basically saying look I I see you doing fabric I see you doing substrate and you keep talking about this thing called human 3.0 what exactly is all of this like what what are all these different projects how do they fit together are they all related what is going on and the answer is yes they are all related and I'm going to talk about how in this post okay so I like to start everything with a problem right I don't like to talk about Solutions which all of these are solutions to something right all of these different projects here they're all solutions to something and uh I don't like to jump immediately into talking about the solutions I'd rather talk about the problem that we're trying to solve first so these are roughly the major problems that I'm trying to solve currently with all my different work so uh WP stands for world problem and uh wp1 is humans are suffering from a lack of purpose and meaning in their lives which is causing mental health and societal problems so lack of meaning I would say if we had to make this um three words lack of purpose or lack of meaning I would say is number one okay second one humans do not understand and are not prepared for the sophistication and speed of introduction of AI into our society which will cause major work disruptions and exacerbate our lack of purpose so this is essentially the introduction of AI exacerbating the problem of number one okay so number one is a lack of purpose or meaning number two is AI is going to make it way worse and number three is humans are not trained to become full spectrum people but rather to become economically useful to a materialistic and transactional economy okay so this one's a little bit different very related though all three of these are related so essentially my work is centered mostly around solving those issues right now and I actually have multiple other problems to find which uh in my ts file I also have associated with other strategies and solutions and projects and stuff like that but these are the core these are the top three so next thing to say is that I am a security person I've always been a security person since the mid to late 90s and uh I always will be so I am going to continue doing security work I I think about everything in terms of security like it's just part of my DNA I can't unsee it every time I see any system I think about how transparent it is I think about ways to fix it break it um I'm always red teaming everything right so another way to think about this is that I view AI as containing security right I I feel like it contains security because if you think about it security is actually this is one of my favorite things about security is that uh it's Latin and it means SE which is without and Kura which is worry so without worry and if you think about the problems here I am worried about these I believe humans uh consciously or unconsciously are worried about these things so I'm trying to remove the worry from these things so people can go on and be extremely productive and have meaning meaningful lives right so ultimately this is all kind of the same thing it's all kind of a giving people security so that they can Thrive I mean that's that's ultimately what this is all about now um there are two main ways that I'm basically pursuing this uh continuing to pursue this on the security side tangible ways like I'm going to do it all the time I'm still advising I'm still Consulting I'm still doing assessments but in terms of actual projects these are my two main projects that I still have going and I continue to upgrade as well so one is called Helios which is continuous attack surface monitoring which I'm um now starting to add AI stuff to as well but essentially I've been running this for years and years I still have paying customers on it and uh I I just love attack surface management I love automatically quickly discovering vulnerabilities and then being able to find the weaknesses there um or or finding attack service and then being able to find the weaknesses in the attack surface and then going on to exploitation um and then reporting on that alerting very quickly that that's a thing that I just love um and I think it very much applies to like the world around me I basically want Helios for everything so that's like basically the platform that I'm building there but this one specifically is Just for information security attack service and it's an actual product that you know uh customers can actually send up for uh this next one is called domain and this one is relatively new it's basically security program management using the TS infrastructure which I'm going to talk about later and this is an actual project um and an actual product as well okay so those are the two main security projects that I'm going to be focused on and will continue to be focused on so now let's get into the main core ones uh that are more closely tied to the problems that we just talked about so the projects are substrate fabric TS Damon and hum 3.0 which is kind of the centerpiece for all of these so we're going to look at each one individually first and then how they work together so I have a full explainer video here uh on substrate which uh we we'll put a link to there at the top and also this will all be in the description for the video but uh substrate has its own video it's got its own full Blog Page and everything full description but it is an open- Source framework for increasing human understanding meaning and progress so it's basically designed to make things that matter to humans more transparent discussible and ultimately fixable um and I've got an example here that I that I put in just to um remind you from the actual page so it's basically a map to explain things and solve problems and it's so big that it it's kind of abstract so it's better to use an example so here's an example of an argument component in fact I'm going to pull up an actual argument component which I submitted uh which is even better but think of an argument you might hear on any given day about whatever topic right so I don't know why you recycle it's a total waste it cost so much to recycle you know the programs are poorly run or whatever so this is an argument that you would hear in normal life right so what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to make it easier for humans to communicate with each other using tangible transparent things not just throwing out random claims which are opaque and you can't possibly research them and it's just a whole bunch of like mini claims inside of one big claim and then you basically have just rhetoric being shot you know between two people and it's just a total waste so we're confronted by this type of thing constantly uh about recycling but things that matter a lot more than that you know other type of political things but what subst can do is it can take all these have ai wrapped around them right so they're not AI by themselves it's actually mostly text components is is what all of these are mostly based around okay text this this is my religion text it's why I love Vim so much I love Clarity of thought Clarity of understanding Clarity of articulation of problems solutions can you give it to me in 10 paragraphs awesome can you give it to me in 10 sentences even better can you give it to me in 10 words I want to be able to go from three words to 10 words to 10 sentences to 10 paragraphs to 10 chapters which is a book or whatever to 10 books to 10 libraries full of whatever all explaining one concept right it I'm just obsessed with this and so much of what I'm doing here has to do with this simple concept of being able to explain things perfectly clearly there's no such thing as perfect but extremely clearly explain Concepts in a way that's tangible and and you could sort of like communicate efficiently as a result of both of you having a crystal clear idea of what the conversation is in both of your minds okay so this is a the biggest part of substrate is having Universal things that you can point to which are the transparent components that are used to assemble a conversation assemble a discussion okay when somebody proposes a solution okay they're proposing something they're like I believe I can solve this problem if you elect me I will whatever we will have ice cream for lunch every day at the at the um at our Middle School right I think that was Napoleon Dynamite or whatever it was a some kind of thing where he was like making these promises but the point is I can put all the promises in text I could say it's going to happen by this time I could say we're going to raise our uh test scores by this much if we do this um we're going to have more fun based on this fun meter right so we can have like metrics we can have kpis we can have all these things and they're all published and then the promise at the bottom says something like if I don't raise these numbers by this time then you should vote me out and now this is published this is the platform right you could do this for politics you could do this for all sorts of things anyway so that that just shows you how powerful the text is and why I'm so on about it okay so um what you could do with that once you have it set right watch this this is actually an argument okay this is uh the substrate thing but this is an actual argument uh Broken Out In mermaid JS and if you zoom in to actually go into this image it's actually showing the relationship between all the claims whether or not they're valid or not and the better AI gets it's going to be able to go and independently research all these different claims and light up these different boxes as like green or red or orange or whatever right so now it's like as somebody's talking I mean this is not too far away you have like an AR interface and as somebody is talking and they're like ah and that's why and then this thing happened in the conspiracy and then they plan to kill me and then blah blah blah and you just see all these claims popping up and then you see your AI in the background it's going to research that claim comes back turns it red okay like this little node right here will turn red dink didn't happen nope already you know debunked and so the bottom also turns red and it's like chances of this person being full of 94% okay this is the type of thing we will be able to do very quickly very soon because of all the ways that Tech is advancing not just AI but lots of different Tech is advancing and so we're going to be able to have interfaces that like detect lies and detect deception and you know find interesting arguments and and it's not just adversarial it's not just finding it's also when someone starts talking your AI can remind you they're talking about stuff that you really like right and you don't need an AI for that you're obviously going to know that yourself just by hearing but let's say you're having a conversation that's boring with some business partner but right next to you in the Starbucks or whatever your AI is also listening to that conversation next door it's a public conversation they were being loud no big deal but it's like hey you should probably close things down with this person you're talking to and go talk to her instead because she's trying to solve x problem which is related to your y problem and that's probably a much more interesting and fruitful conversation right anyway lots of different like there's just so much here and there's so many different components to substrate but that's essentially what it is right shared understanding and problem solving so when people meet each other discuss things disagree or whatever various components of the proposal or conversation can be made visible and transparent okay proposals problems solutions arguments entered into AI as a context which point research Ed it at which point research can be done or analysis can be done Counterpoint generation progress tracking it it's just insane I really really excited about this project oh and I wanted to show you an argument um because we actually have an argument so just put it up recently so if we go to okay if we go to arguments I just put this one in recently it's the first one actually so you see the structure here is a AR uh 12934 that was uh random so I just randomly made that and then I have a quick talk top level summary using underscore connections uh so it's all one uh word uh but if we go into this thing look at this AIS are capable of understanding I've got a claim here which is uh what that is argument style it's a deductive argument which means building claims that lead to a conclusion and if you want to disagree with a conclusion you have to find a problem with the previous statements right and then I've got a series of statements that result in the conclusion which is number eight therefore AIS are capable of understanding and the way that matters to us as humans so this is a very basic you know markdown structure um or pure text structure whatever you want to call it and uh that's an example of uh an argument inside of substrate okay so let's go to the next one um fabric okay fabric you've probably heard the most about uh if if you haven't that's fine if you're brand new here uh welcome and there's lots to talk about with fabric um I would say a couple of hundred people have made other YouTube videos around fabric uh so there's like tons of um introductory videos um I've got an introduction to fabric actually that's this one here um introducing the whole concept uh which I'm also going to talk about here as well but the probably the best two are the one from Network Chuck uh that's an extraordinary one actually it's this one here and then also David Bumble I did an interview with him uh and with network truck so both of those intro videos are really really good plus I've got this one here and um essentially what it is it's an open source framework for augmenting humans using AI so the problem is that there's so much AI out there there's so many websites so many mobile apps so many everything out there that it's like okay what do I use how do I solve this problem that I have so what fabric is it's a collection of problems and solutions so um I'm actually just going to go into um yeah let's go into the GitHub page so when you go into the patterns which is what these things are called these patterns are actually um they're actually problems okay analyze in they actions to take on a problem okay analyze email headers analyze incident analyze logs analyze personality you could put like you could put like people's uh social posts in here you could put like whatever you want in there and it will like do an analysis of their personality analyze Pros to fix your writing analyze threat reports whole bunch of information security stuff in here secure by Design questions um also security related um create aphorisms create a formal email create a horoi offer this is a business uh creation thing you could visualize anything uh you can create an NPC for a role playing game like all of these these solve very specific tasks that humans need to solve during the course of a day so rather than trying to make up prompts like all of these are prompts okay but they're all custom tuned in a very clear format to solve a very specific problem so now what you do is you call Fabric and you could use that in a text interface we've got a a UI that you can use it's designed to be mostly command line but now we have a UI a web UI that you can use and there's also raycast support so I'm goingon to take this whole page that I just uh that that I'm actually doing this video on right now right so I'm going to copy this and then I'm going to do raycast and I'm going to do extract wisdom and then it's already highlighted so I'm going to tab over I'm going to paste and I press enter now look at this boom it's doing fabric extract wisdom or actually in this case it's doing extract ideas I think no no this is extract wisdom yep yep that's the rast one I did okay so look these top ones are the ideas now it's insights quotes look it's doing the quotes that came from the page so now instead of having to go into the command line I can now invoke this fabric project from raycast uh which is pretty cool so that's essentially what this is so it's everyday things right learning studying self-improvement problem solving all these different things are things that you could do inside of Fab brick okay so let's look over here um I'm in the command line now and I'm going to blow this up a little bit for you and we are looking at the fabric patterns this is a better way to look at it than the web page actually so you scroll through here look at this look at all these and I added like a lot of these uh initially I added all of them but now I mean this is all open source all of these things are open source like probably over a hundred of these have been submitted by the community from all over the world there's like over a 100 developers on this thing at this point um I I think we got like 23,000 stars or something and um these are all specific problems that you can solve using fabric right on the command line in the guey or in raycast and there's lots of other ways to interface with it as well so that that's the concept you have specific things you want to get done there's a million AI tools out there there's a million different prompts that you can use with a million different tools so this is a way to use one framework that uses prompts specifically to solve different problems so you just do fabric the name of the problem you're solving and boom you get back your answer so that's the idea there so next one TS this is a relatively new launch I've been doing this actually for years just in text you know just with uh regular cards and uh I've been actually managing uh Security Programs like this for years and years um and doing security assessments uh like this for years and years but now with AI it's getting even more powerful so this is a full Project based around this concept so essentially it is creating deep context about things that matter to humans and you're going to notice that there's natural interaction and overlap with subst and with fabric and in fact the way they work together is just insane cuz guess what it's all based on text AI loves text it it's it's insane how all these work together and dynamically play off each other and like magnify each other so let's go into this articulate the mission of this thing articulate deep context about the things that matter to humans okay open- Source framework for creating deep context about things that matter to humans the framework allows us to use AI to manage entities of any size from individuals to teams to organizations to companies I mean honestly it's like countries planets you know solar systems like it doesn't matter how big the thing is you can manage it in this way just a question of like how big is a file get and how much are you abstracting away the different components um so the GitHub page I mean I've only got a couple things in there right now and we'll just go in there so what what I have in here I actually have a published full TS file for this fictional company called Alma which is something I do in a lot of my security talks I use this as the example but look at this we got a company mission for this uh fictional company called Alma we've got a company goals we've got company kpis most importantly because it's security oriented we have the security team Mission look at this sm1 each one of these are tagged with a specific thing so that the AI can cross reference the context and understand the whole thing and if you've not seen my my videos on how AI understands you definitely want to go check that out because it heavily heavily relates to TS but also to substrate and basically all this stuff but look at this so uh security team Mission security team goals look at this this is what we're trying to do this is this is how we measure our success this is our risk register this is what we're really worried about we've got all these narratives we got current risk we got strategies we got like how we're doing which we've just sort of written out and I've got a video coming out soon I'm still doing this as uh paid talks uh around the world so I'm not releasing this yet but at some point I'm going to release maybe an a bridge version of this and by the way I am releasing it inside the UL community so uh if you're already a member of the community or you want to sign up you're going to have a version of this full paid talk very soon um look at this team members what they're good at how much money they make NAIA is doing well check her out uh projects project name like who's actually running it um the schedule uh the time frame all the different stuff and then look at this this is the list of metrics that are happening right updates to the metrics and using this I don't want to go too far into this but using this I can manage the entire program it is absolutely insane so that's what we have in t so far and I've only uploaded the corporate one this is how I manage my own life actually I do everything with a TS file my whole life is in a TS file I have my traumas I have relationships I have my business goals I have my personal goals I have my eulogy goals I have everything in there my favorite mental models my ideas that I've come up with which we're going to talk about in the Damon part all this different stuff it's all in one context you feed that to an AI and by the way be careful what you put in your TS file if you're sending it to a cloud thing I I have mine you know fairly uh safe and sanitized so I'm not like uh airing any laundry or something like that besides everyone kind of has the same problems so I'm I'm not super worried about like I'm a special Snowflake and I hope nobody finds out about this or whatever so I'm not really concerned about that but be careful if you put something in your TS file and then you upload it somewhere just something to think about not not something to panic about just something to think about um but because I have everything in there all my goals all my aspirations what I hope somebody would say at my eulogy when I die when I'm 137 when my human body dies not actually going to die when my human body dies um so uh when that happens what are they supposed to say are they going to be like no I mean he made a good chicken tortilla uh you know he he really likes salsa like I don't want people to say that in my eulogy I want them to say nice things that I've done well guess what I have to do those things before that time right so so this is kind kind of stuff I put in my ts file and um it it's just really really powerful so it doesn't matter if you are managing an ice cream truck or you are trying to run a family or you trying to get your life on track and have purpose in your life which we're going to come back to that that's like the central theme doesn't matter what you're managing if you get promoted to Galactic ruler of the Milky Way you need something like this okay hopefully it's still text hopefully you're still using them when you get that promotion I would be um but uh you basically can manage anything like this from the smallest thing a personal workout routine all the way to you are the director of the Milky Way okay um got some additional context in here I've got the link here to the corporate toos which we just looked at I'm going to be uploading soon a template for the personal TS and different templates for different types of organization or entity so that's uh that's TS so personal well not personal but deep edit so deep context about things that matter to humans again at all scales okay ourselves teams organization companies Etc now um one last piece on this in terms of application so once the AI sees everything this is what we were talking about before once the AI sees everything purpose goals challenges strategies kpis now we can start asking questions we can start taking actions what mistakes are we making that are holding us back as a company as an ice cream truck business right um if this happens what should we do absolutely insane I I've got examples of doing this for a security program I have it in this talk it's absolutely insane what's the biggest thing I could do right now to be more efficient to better pursue my goals right explain how so and so expert would look at my relationships explain how so and so expert I have a favorite uh Fitness person that I love and I would love to see what he thinks about my workout program so I could just ask that question okay and then if he's also a psychologist he can just look at my entire thing and be like hey here's what I think you should do so analyzing your life and your goals and your strategies for achieving them in the mind of Richard fean or um Naval rant or whoever your favorite person is you could use their eyes to look at your stuff and give you analysis why because it's all in one place this is a thing that so few of us have and TS is the structure for allowing you to have it as well okay next one here Damon this one is brand new this one came out when I wrote this uh article or this post this uh collection post here however I have been talking about it forever uh in fact since 2016 uh in uh the real internet of things which I don't think I have it linked here but um you can find it on Amazon it's called the real Internet of Things the concept for demon an open-source framework for personal apis now it's actually any API it's more like entity apis but I decided to use the word personal might change it not sure the concept here is that when you have a TS file or you have a web page or you have whatever ever and you have listed your individual ideas that you've come up with you have listed your individual preferences your favorite foods your favorite movies um who you're looking for in a relationship or whatever these are just API endpoints and because of AI and because of not just AI but like the tech that we have now things like Postman uh I mean it's absolutely insane you could parse a TS file have a section called private and public and be like look for all the public ones post these make these available as a public API of my favorite books and guess what it spawns and on the endpoint SL books or slf favorite uncore books someone can just pull that and the whole purpose of this if you check out the book The Real Internet of Things your Damon this is my prediction going back all the way to then your Damon will know you intimately because of your T Los file actually and it will be parsing all of the Demons around us business demons uh individual demons cars objects whatever okay they're all publishing like the trees's current water level the trees's current happiness level like is it drooping or whatever and maybe you could see that but you can't see it from you know across the so I could I could ask a question how healthy are all the trees and broom that was actually a query to the API or maybe they pushed it but maybe it was a a poll type of query anyway the point is you can ask a question of a city how happy are we okay and now we just live uh hit the API for all these different people who have it published and and are okay with putting their current mood out there or whatever so now we have a live Beacon of what is happening inside of a room inside of a small City a small town a village or a planet right my favorite case of this is you walk into a Starbucks okay I'm just going to pull this up I'm I'm pull this up um give me a second here boom boom AI yeah here we go predictable yeah so watch this the stuff is all related okay I actually should have put this in um um in the post uh I'm I'm glad it's in this video so this is an illustrated 9000w version updated version of essentially the book that I did in 2016 okay um so what part are we on um so we have digital assistance everything gets an API yeah this is it okay so everything gets an API Damon Aura so I called it Damon for this GitHub project so watch this AIS will understand things by what they broadcast so look at this got some art for it I spent so long on this post like please go read it um okay which I call a Damon which is Greek for Spirit um so don't think demon although everyone will of course but uh businesses uh people whatever look at this for a restaurant here's your Damon menu hour staff so look watch this you're moving through the world okay this is you moving through the world Your da which is your personal AI on your iOS device or your Android device or whatever your meta uh glasses whatever it is it knows everything about you it's constantly aware and awake and constantly reading news for you and presenting things to you um most importantly it's reading all the demons around it okay it's parsing oh there's a uh free biscuit over here at this little restaurant oh uh this tie place you love that tie place and Sarah just said it's the best ever and you should go there and the the owner really wants to see you has he hasn't seen you in a while whatever a plant over here needs watering right you can take some water that's in your thermos and go water that plant all this stuff is avail able to the DA there are thousands of Damons running in this picture Okay thousands you're trying to have a conversation with your friend who's standing right next to you this is them okay you can't be interrupted you don't you're not going to pull up a list of Damons and be like Oh I'm going to go look at the menu for this restaurant not going to happen your AI is going to do it for you okay so watch this catalog about this is for businesses right every business becomes an API okay the catalog the about the contact how how to do whatever why contact because you could just say holy crap these headphones just broke hey um Dara which is the name of my uh my AI hey Dara um tell this company like I'm really upset that this just broke guess what darca does guess what my AI does my AI queries their contact thing or queries their their uh support thing and submits a thing and actually takes a little piece of my voice or a video takes a little video I'm like hey see this look at this cable this Cable's like it's frayed I got this thing two days ago you can see here's the receipt boom darca sends the receipt and boom I I didn't do anything I didn't hit an API my da my digital assistant my da darca hit it for me because everyone has these available okay and if you're a person and you're trying to date you might have like a dating thing that's open it's like oh this person like um you know likes climbing the same way you do and her top you know three books are the same as yours look at this people will have demons oras right demons oras whatever who who knows what it's going to be called like I'm not going to be able to control that I'm going to call it a demon I think that's a cool name plus it's Greek and it sounds like demon but it's not demon anyway um look at this look at this when people have demons displayed it'll be objects as well cuz the object might show it's working or it's not working or it's like it's overwhelmed or it's not overwhelmed but watch this for a person look I'm looking through glasses eventually it'll be contact lenses and after that it'll be a a brain implant like a neuralink the first iteration this is going to be glasses right I'm looking at this person in the Starbucks and they've got this is what darca is showing me darca is using an interface to interpret their Damon and display it in this form maybe maybe they want it um to display it in this form or maybe my da Dara chose to show it to me in this form okay but regardless it's going to look different okay because um this one might for example if might indicate extreme creativity so I'm going to be like oh crap you're awesome I know you're awesome I'm looking at your aura right now like what do you into and then they're they're like oh I love writing about this I love doing that so like just so much potential here um this one here I already did a post about this one I I already did video so I can't I can't go into it I'm already OV excited let's move on bottom line here for Damon everything will be broadcasting an API all of the projects that I'm talking about in this video toos fabric substrate all of these different things a lot of it focuses on self articulation self- understanding and presentation out to people okay not because you're trying to be an influencer you know forget influencers like influencer is like it's such a it's an anti-pattern it's a toxic version of the thing that I am talking about which we're going to get to which is human 3.0 okay but but you're you're going to see how this is all forming together so watch this people should be broadcasting people should be showing what they're into okay we already do this with the clothes that we wear with the accessories that we carry with the conversations that we have with with our facial expressions with whether or not we smile or or do whatever when we look at people so the point is being an influencer is like artificially opening up this this uh spigot that has been closed because we've been in human 2.0 for too long which is basically human 2.0 is basically saying look if you want to talk about your skills with your company that's fine but I don't need to know about it right and anybody who wants to talk about what they're into and share what they're into you must be a narcissist you must be an influencer type who just wants to be famous or whatever no listen to me humans are designed here's my argument humans should be sharing with other humans every about you I'm not talking about private stuff okay I'm talking about everything about you you love gardening you love reading you love all these things this is meant to be shared okay not because you're an influencer but because you care about these things and you want to connect with other people who care about these things that is a human thing forget Tech okay I I want to remind you about something everything in here all this stuff this is not Tech I don't want you to think about tech and you damn sure shouldn't be thinking about AI AI is nothing but intelligence okay forget any of that this is all human-based stuff everything about this you see this person in the middle forget this bubble around him that's an API nobody cares what I care about is walking into a coffee shop and having my da go hey I know you're reading but uh this guy who just walked in he is reading the same same book as you and it is listed as his number two book in his uh books and point on his Damon and um he's also doing a little side business that looks like this and uh yeah I think you'd really enjoy talking to him uh do you want me to Ping his da um so my da pings his da and we look at each other and we're like hey what's up you want to get a coffee let me buy you a coffee so that is a human thing that is not a tech thing that is Tech enabling human things everything here substrate fabric it's all the same fabric is not Tech problems fabric is full of human problems TS is not capturing Tech stuff it's capturing a business it's capturing a person it's capturing a program to do something better than it was done before okay all of this is humans look at this mission for Damon broadcasting forget influencers the fact that only influencers are sharing anything about themselves is evidence of a broken society that that's the problem that's what human 3.0 is undoing that okay so watch this Mission share yourself with Humanity that's that's it share yourself with Humanity it doesn't have to be everything okay you put what you want in your demon and you can even have it blocked off and everything like the the better the tech gets the more you're going to need authentication to get to certain ones and only friends can see it like all that will come but essentially what this is starting with is a structure for defining your personal API okay so that's what it's going to be it's a schema and essentially what I'm doing here and this is pretty early on for this one what I'm going to do here is I'm going to have the schema I'm have the ab uh templates for the schema for people to fill in I'm also going to have um collectors that go and get it from your content if you want to run that you just run it yourself it goes and collects all your different stuff and then it puts it in there and then of course you can edit it and then I'm going to have like a Docker container I'm going to have like a domain setup or something like that where it all connects together and you press go and broom it spins up and on a particular domain that is associated with you you will now be broadcasting your Damon and then as people start to spin up their Das and when people meet each other so for example you could have like on your necklace thing or in a in a Damon broadcast that is actually local or on a arm patch that is a QR code those can all be URLs to your actual Damon so when your personal um Tech that you're walking with has a camera on it which is absolutely coming absolutely coming very soon I mean metag glasses already do but I'm talking about a continuous camera when it sees somebody's QR code walking by broom it pulls the thing assuming it's not already broadcasting and can't detect it in a different way the point is we're going to move through the world seeing each other broadcasting it's going to be absolutely beautiful seeing each other broadcasting seeing each other surrounded in these auras of of purple and pink and like you know uh equations floating over somebody or like they're wrapped in Vines we know they love plants like it's just going to be extraordinary and don't think at all about the tech think about the connection to humanity that we will have enabled by tech tech should disappear okay if I'm walking through the world and I see somebody and they look awesome and they smiling and they appear to be wrapped in plants and the plants are like moving and like you know they they just look like one with nature or plants or whatever I'm not thinking about tech I'm like I'm thinking they really like plants and so do I so I'm going to talk to them me as a human I'm going to talk to that person as human and we're going to talk about plants and soil and stuff all right that's ston personal API broadcast okay now this brings us to the big one human 3.0 I've been talking about this I've been mentioning it I've been saying the word for a very long time and uh it's time to talk about it so human 3.0 is a framework and platform for upgrading humans both a framework and a platform we're going to go into this its purpose is to help people transition from being a detail in the Legacy corporate-based economy to a new model of success based on self articulation and expression okay quite different from the others because it's basically the container for all these other ones so all these other ones are moving towards this thing which hopefully you've been picking up uh as I've been talking it's all moving towards this bigger thing of human to human connection and actually an economy and society that is based on that which not only do I think would be nice okay I'm I'm not basically saying oh wouldn't it be nice if this was happening wouldn't it be nice if this were true I am saying that but I'm mostly saying the thing we're currently doing is not going to work anymore because the economy that we have is based on humans mostly doing human 2.0 stuff in a very materialistic and short-sighted economy where you spend from 9 in the morning to 5:00 in the evening doing something basically inan which drives you insane makes you crave the weekend and absolutely dread Monday coming up I don't know what percentage of the world is like that but it's a lot why do we get a thumbs up what happened dreading Monday is not a thumbs up I don't know why I did that listen um sound like Biden listen listen folks okay so another way to State this uh is it's infrastructure that can make human 3.0 happen okay all right so now let's talk about the the core philosophy here of human 3.0 so here are the main Concepts again there's a platform component of this as well so it's an actual thing that you can go and do you could sign up for and actually go through that's what not what we're talking about here first we're going to about the philosophy and the framework itself number one humans have been trained over the last 150 years to become corporate workers and to primarily identify ourselves as corporate workers okay this was never ideal for humans and its time has now passed so AI is about to remove or disrupt most knowledge work and arguably a lot of other work once robots come uh as well but either way we have to get ready for what's coming next and what I believe is coming next is becoming self-actualized full spectrum humans that can create and offer value to other humans okay other humans this transition requires a different way of thinking about how we learn things and how we Define and pursue success and it also involves becoming radically self-aware becoming continuous Learners who have the creative and Financial Freedom to spend their time doing purposeful work that they enjoy that is the philosophy for human 3.0 okay and I'm going to update this I'll continue to improve I'll add some things remove them but ultimately this is the core of it so here are the components okay this is for the the actual platform okay so I want you to think of this human 3.0 is a vision that I'm saying it's a thing that we should be thinking about it's what I believe the future is this has nothing to do with a platform it has nothing to do with tech I believe this is a changing of old to new from Legacy to what is coming and importantly I think there's a chasm in between these two things okay I'm worry that we're being hit with AI and it's about to wreck hundreds of millions no billions of people it's about to wreck billions of people especially the hundreds of Millions who work in knowledge work um so we have Legacy human 2.0 we have I I think that was going bad anyway because of the loss of religion and for a lot of other reasons we were already sort of steering into a bad place with a lack of meaning and this is like 5 10 years ago okay it's already going to a bad place and then you got social media you got tech tech is causing more problems um But ultimately it comes down to we lost community and we lost religion and uh it it was just taking us in a bad place now bring AI in and one of the core things that gives us meaning as humans is actually our work the fact that we feel like we're making some sort of contribution to work somebody appreciates what we're doing we're obviously having some sort of positive output otherwise they wouldn't be paying us okay so that that's a vibe that that's a thing that does give some meaning to people's lives now ai is coming to crush that not actually not on purpose but it will it will have the effect of removing or massively disrupting hundreds of millions of jobs uh that's my belief it's a belief of a lot of experts some people don't agree doesn't doesn't really matter let's assume it's 10% worse or 90% worse or better it does matter the actual numbers directionally you you should believe this it is true that that's my claim now given that the disruption is going to be extraordinary to society to everyone I have no idea what's going to happen the the number of variables are far too large anyone who tells you they can predict specific implementations of Technology they are lost and you should not listen to them what I'm trying to predict is based on human desires based on what humans want and have always wanted so I'm I'm trying to make some somewhat like Evergreen except for futur looking predictions that are based on what we know humans need and how they're going to get that from the world so that that's essentially what I'm trying to do here and what I'm principally worried about if you go back to wp1 it's the loss of meaning and wp2 is the loss of meaning exacerbated by AI taking jobs so that's what it comes down to now the second piece is a platform that I am building an actual platform a tech platform that helps you figure out what human 3.0 is and it takes you through a giant series of steps it's a guided walk through of steps in a curated you know organized way so it's a full set of video courses like I haven't built all this stuff yet um fully um I'm I'm still working on the curriculum but it's essentially a curriculum it's videos it's all this different stuff uh this is not the pitch for that so I'm not going to go into that here but it shows you like how to use teos how to build your TS file yourself um how to use fabric to look at your TS file how to build your Damon it's like basically a walk through of how to actually go and Implement all this other stuff but here's the point you don't actually need this thing that I'm building okay you don't need it all you have to do is look at all the other projects which are the core projects you can actually just go get them use them the way I talk about in the videos and you're already doing it you're already moving towards uh human 3 .0 and I'm going to make the assessment like the assessment is going to be available also open source so it's like you could do all this stuff without the platform 100% like that's the way it's designed um but some people they want to be walked through it they wanted to be walk through it in an organized way and that's why I'm building the human 3.0 platform which is called H3 so yeah all the different stuff shows you how to build online presence shows you shows you how to have uh like lots of different income streams and all all that kind of stuff oh here we go I actually answered this why make a platform you can honestly get what I'm offering here by going watching every video this is exactly what I was just saying right um You can do all of that in fact a lot of people already have so they're already on the path if not already achieved uh human 3.0 the platform is just a guided version of it so that that's all it is um all right so I got a section here why listen to me this is mostly because of the platform because they're like yeah why am I going to do a platform like who the hell is this person I'm not going to go into this it's kind of gross it's just like N I did this I did that blah blah blah some people need to see this before they will listen so that's what and that's why I have it way down here because it's like not important it it's just me I'm going to throw up my mouth just looking at it um yeah how to charge for for it not sure yet it's going to be some kind of subscription maybe pay for the courses I don't know um that's on the platform side I'm not worried about it again you don't need the platform all right component summary so here's what we're going to do we're going I'm going to summarize in a couple of different ways all of this different stuff okay everything that we've talked about so far so um substrate shared library of transparent objects that matter to humans oh yeah and I'm putting this free and open source all of it fabric shared library of AI prompts that solve human problems also free and open source all all these free open source TLO structure for capturing deep context about something humans care about free and open source Damon system for publishing an entity to the world as an API and presenting that content on a website oh yeah that's the other thing about Damon which I forgot to mention I'm actually going to use the Damon structure for the API to also be a website navigation structure so you know how when you go to a website it's like oh there's pull Downs for like projects or about or whatever well all of those I'm actually going to Source out of TS and the Damon so that those are available so that when you update your TS file or you update your source of Truth wherever that is that can then propagate to your website as well so it's like you you have this vibrant like always aware sort of broadcast of yourself and then human 3.0 is the platform for upgrading yourself it's a a paid program it it it's the program piece but the human 3.0 concept is actually just the combination of all of these put together which doesn't require um any platform whatsoever it's just like all Concepts and all open source projects all right so summary unify my work around a central Mission which is helping people transition to this concept of human 3.0 multiple components uh substrate fabric TS Damon all focused on helping people and organizations not just people articulate what they are about so they can better improve themselves common themes here Clarity transparency continuous optimization and most importantly purpose purpose absolutely important it's it's in the wp1 through3 right they all significant this one's important they all significantly feature AI because of its ability to see patterns across multiple contexts so here's what's really crazy you could take your TS file you could take your Damon you could take all all this stuff and put these into context and send them to fabric I I I do this all the time I do this multiple times per day and then that same content can be part of your Damon right and then those different components can be broken off and put into substrate all of those go into another context those get sent to AI you can ask all sorts of interesting questions and take actions all based on all this being unified into context and when you think about AI context sizes are getting bigger and bigger rag is getting bigger and bigger but essentially you're going to be able to have your entire life in apple is working on this that's what they're working on with their AI which is going to take a while to develop same with Google Google's going to have it as well meta is going to have it as well and a whole bunch of third parties are going to have it right you're going to have the ability to have every image you've ever taken every thought you've ever had every idea you've ever had that was you know uh original and cool all your writing every everything everything about you all in one place and by the way security wise this is going to be nasty it these things are going to get compromised it's going to be really gross no question about that but the value that it's going to bring is going to be so immense and so much more than the risk that one these breaches will happen two they will be really bad and three we will just continue on and do it anyway that's just a fact of the matter for anyone who's security oriented and you're wondering about this that's that's what it is and the final piece is a framework called human 3.0 brings it all together uh both a framework for thinking about progress and a platform but ju just for the sake of this video just think about the framework that unifies it all so what am I hoping you got from this page and from this video one I hope you understand what I'm working on how all these projects go together and why and um that that's number one I I just want you to see why I'm working on these things why I'm so excited about them how they all work together how it's all text based and how they all play into this this uh vision of what I'm seeing happening for human 3.0 and why want to help people get there that's my number one thing is helping people get there so if they get there through the open source projects they get there through watching all the videos um that I assume that's how most people are going to get there and then people are just like show me make it for me uh guide me through it and so I'm going to make a platform that does that um second piece is I want to encourage also known as shame you into doing the same thing this post here not the projects themselves but this post here what I've done is I've basically taken all of my work over the last year and a half really almost basically since going independent maybe two years two and a half years I've taken all that work and I've brought it together into a cohesive explanation of why I'm doing that work what problems that I'm setting out to solve when I talk to people this is what I want to hear from them I want hear from them when I say hey what are you working on I would love this is one of the things I talked about recently I love a particular sentence I believe watch this sentence very powerful great for parties great for like explaining especially professional parties I believe that one of the biggest problems in the world is this which is why I am building this I believe that it will do this for the world which is why I'm doing it so I've defined the problem I've defined what I'm trying to do and I've defined how I think it's going to help right and you could mention kpis there or it could be something more amorphous but I love the clarity of this right I love the clarity of like what are we actually doing here what are we actually doing here and this is a central theme for every single one of these projects projects Clarity cuz Clarity once you lock that in on a purpose that is what gives you fulfillment that is what gives you the ability to like take all this damage from the world right experience all this suffering which I massively learned from Victor Frankle if you are locked on on this distant purpose and you're taking damage it can actually feel good it can actually feel good to struggle right if you're locked on this thing so the second piece of this is I I want to encourage you right you're out there you're working every day you're putting stuff on social media too sometimes maybe depending who I'm talking to your stuff is out there can you describe it crisply can you clarify what problems you're trying to solve can you crystallize it down to 15 words my favorite length for summarizations of this type can you crystallize it to 15 words can you articulate it to a person as I am doing this work because I believe it solves this problem uh and that's why I'm doing these projects right I I I think it's just beautiful I think it's beautiful and part of this is to get my stuff out there right I mean is a thing you have to do you have you have to talk about your work you got to get it out there I want people to be excited all of that but this second piece is just as important I want to see yours now show me yours go and make this something like this half a page whatever it could be a set set of bullets I'm working on this because of this I'm working on this because of this here are the problems I'm trying to solve send them to me Daniel Danel me.com send them to me I want to see what you're working on and I want to see why and uh look forward to seeing you in the next one take care
