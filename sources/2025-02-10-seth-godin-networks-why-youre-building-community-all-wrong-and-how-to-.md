Kind: captions Language: en all right Seth Goden amazing author thinker Community Builder I can't believe he said yes yes so lovely to see you it's been forever you know the people who are tuning in haven't yet heard clearly that you are the OG that you haven't been doing this for a week or a month or a year or a decade that my career wouldn't be my career if it hadn't been for you and you keep showing up to make things better so when you reached out to me it was like instant yes I don't get it it was an instant yes I was like so excited and I I I um I was reflecting on the just how our paths have crossed over the years like I don't even I don't even know if you know this but like I worked at a company that was that in the very early days I was doing early m&amp;a during the do com boom and like I remember yo-yo dying like I was like oh my gosh like this is so cool and then you showed up with tribes in in probably one of again the the most foursided um Concepts Frameworks how you've approached it which I'm hoping we'll we'll get a chance to talk about and then all of the other things that you've experimented with from alt MBA and now the latest book with this is this is strategy you have continually found ways to evolve the fundamental core concept of how do we show up for people and how do we create value for people and how to really create this intersection of business of marketing of community of connection and I'm curious just to start out like is that accurate like how how do you think about it you know I mean that's how I sort of look at it from the outside but it's like you're very kind you know I have I have a simple hack that is served me well for a long time most people who think of themselves as doing business or writing about business say I want to win some prizes how can I use people to help me get what I want right and what I learned from my parents in a long long time of building stuff is there are people who need stuff how can I help people get what they need and maybe make a living doing it yeah and then I try to articulate in a book or a blog post or building a company how you could do that yeah and so when we look at the internet there's plenty of very loud very hyped Hustlers who are doing things to people some of them are billionaires some of them are struggling but it's such such an easy shortcut to put in popups into to spam people and to lock them into places they can't leave and just to seduce into trick and I think we're sort of fortunate that they aren't always winning that there's a different path and that path is resilient and generative and you can be proud of it and that's what I'm trying to help people do I love that I also feel like a kindred spirit because one of the things that you know is is so important to me is getting at the essence of how to create value for people and the the the place where I think the most value has been created and can be created is in relationships and community and one of the things that I love about the latest book this is strategy that you can get your own copy of um is the first thing you say is find a group of people to do this with yeah and the second thing you say is and use modern tools like Claude or chat GPT to to help help you tease out and apply these Concepts and ideas the concepts I I love the opening of the book I I'm going to read this because I think it's it's awesome traction is progress help others get where they're going big problems require small Solutions I want to I want to unpack that one that one's super cool the work is easier if you can see where you're going I think that that when I read that I was like oh my God yes like that is so profound uh what is this one this one is creating change creates tension I can't even read my own handwriting here like um and better as possible yeah and so I I I'd love to to I'd love to hear especially around the big problems require smaller Solutions how you got there well you just got to look around and you might notice things and one of the things you notice when you look around is that all the stuff in our built modern world didn't arrive on overnight Federal Express by Magic it you know we paved the Earth how long did it take to pave the Earth it took a century there when it you know when you when you tried to get people to buy a car they were like well there's no roads and there's no gas stations so I'll just wait until everything is paved and then I'll buy a car and when books first came out with Gutenberg they hadn't invented reading glasses yet and there were no bookstores so it you can't wait until it's all clear before you begin and the other thing about it is you know let's say your goal is to provide Solus and Aid and behavior change to millions and millions and millions of people around the world who are struggling with alcoholism well you could say how am I going to do that in a week or you could say how am I gonna help 12 people in Cleveland sit in a church basement and connect with each other let's build Alcoholics Anonymous and then let's build a a network effect that goes with it because 40 years from now it's going to have changed the world that didn't happen because you said there's a big problem I need a big solution you said can I help 12 people right can I make an impact right here and right now yeah and the same thing is true with every podcast you've ever listened to the first week it only had 10 listeners yeah yeah when um what I what I love about this is one of our themes for this Summit is start where you are and just get started like just take that first step and so for you what what was your first step how did you how did you get started and and and when did you know you had something that you could take to the next level so I'm not a poster child for much um but I will tell you that the way the book business works is every book publisher pretty much until recently pays the same uh royalties but they compete with each other to pay you in advance my first book chip Conley and I wrote together in 1986 probably when you were 12 or something and um we got a $5,000 advance that we had a split but when you get a $5,000 Advance or $50,000 Advance you haven't written the book yet but suddenly you know there's going to be a book because now you owe now now you're on the hook and everything that happens after that is not should there be a book because there will be a book and the magic of what you're doing with this $199 thing is so simple which is you know if someone on Tik Tok show up and says pay me $199 and I'll tell you some secrets you should change the channel but when Gina shows up after doing this for more than a decade and says you should pay $199 you should do that because it's in advance yeah not because Gina needs the money not because you can't use the money on something else but because once you pay the advance now there is going to be a network and everything you're going to do is going to be about the incremental stepwise progression to make it work work so my blog which in April is going to have its 10,000th blog post I've written it every single day for more than 25 years um I don't decide every day that I've written a perfect blog post so there'll be a post tomorrow yeah what I do is I decide that it's Wednesday and so since tomorrow is Thursday there's gonna be a blog post because I already decided that and once you make this commitment that you're going to put this group together the smallest viable Unit A a group that's worth it but tiny then you've done the hardest part but what most people do is they go tldr what's the next trauma or urgency of the moment oh what did he say over there and what did they don't do that just commit to something and then show up to justify the fact that you committed yeah I love that when did you so so in your journey like have you always seen the power of taking Concepts and ideas manifested through books or manifested through your blog and turn them into communities or how did that happen for you well I dare say I have failed more times than anyone who's listening to this and I'm proud of it because the failures you know if you're not saying this might not work then you're not innovating you have to be okay with the things that don't work and the things you quit I'm thinking back okay so I would guess the first moment where I started to feel the power of community as a organizer was uh when I was a sophomore in high school they opened a new high school so they moved 400 of us from two other high schools into the new high school well this is like skiing fresh powder because nothing has been formed yet yeah and there was a uh a college bowl type show on television in buffalo called it's academic and there were three people from each high school and they would compete with the buzzers and the whole thing that's awesome and um I was a nerd and um I thought I would love to be on this TV show pressing the buzzer so what's the best way to do that start the club in the high school because if I'm the starter of the club I can be on the team right and so then I had to teach myself relays and stuff to build the buzzer system so we could practice and it turned out I was the seventh best person on the team and so I wasn't even an alternate but what I learned from that crew of Nells and lonely nerds is we wanted connection we didn't want to be lonely alone we wanted to be lonely together and those weekly or twice a week week meetings yeah really resonated with me and I got to be the coach we actually made it to the finals and we lost because the question that they asked which Sheldon prman answered on the last round was what was the name of the first man-made satellite in space I still remember this because Sheldon buzzed in and he said Sputnik and the host looked at his card I can't believe this and he said nope the answer is Sputnik one and I leaped out of my chair like U you know some BB coach and I said it wasn't called Sputnik one until there was Sputnik 2 and they said sit down and shut up we lost but the point of the story and I do have a point is connecting seven people help me understand that while the easy thing to do is to put something behind a pay wall and sell that in some form the way uh the people at um uh I always forget the name the the way that many online uh sites have said we have this video we have this course you can pay money to see it that's easy to sell because you've created tension and people want to know what's in there right and they have to pay Master Class to get it here's a celebrity pay master class and get it and when I started the alt MBA I said there are no secrets in here there are no there's no access to Seth Goden I'm not going to show up but you know who else is going to show up people like you yeah and you're going to engage with each other and it's going to cost way more than master class and as a result far fewer people signed up but the people who signed up and there's now more than 5,000 alums around the world it changed their life right because it's this isn't about consumption it's about connection yeah it this is something that for me was always intuitive and then one of our Mighty hosts a guy named Dan Miller um said it he's like people pay attention to what they pay for and when you want results and transformation in your life the best way to get those results in transformation is to actually make an investment and and that's not and and I'm not saying that from the perspective of like you know hearkening back to the offer that we just made it we see this all the time the people who are running or participating in communities that are about exactly what you're talking about creating that people magic they are much more engaged they have significantly longer retention and they are willing to pay more money because it's about taking a framework not content but taking a framework and the act of of investing in applying that framework to get results to get transformation in their lives and it it's one of these things that the IDE the idea of selling you know a product to you to your point like a a tangible thing feels like it is easier to sell and in some cases it is it is easier to sell a t-shirt that hearkens to sort of a a a longing for some kind of identity than it is to say hey join this community join this program join this Challenge and it will actually be more rewarding and more valuable and sometimes people have to to do it to really sort of see and feel it it's one of the things that I found with Community um Builders is especially those that are new to it it's like it's so fun and I'm drawn to it but I can't exactly put words against why it is so rewarding to create a community to participate in a lively one but it's something that like it's so different than any of to your point any of the gurus or any of the highly polished this is about buying membership when it really is about consuming content what's been your experience with that your your your you're nodding because it's like it's it's like this club that we're all a member of of like no no no when you create a community and when people are actually helping each other or taking pictures because they just met up live in Amsterdam or you know someplace that you've never been and it's all from your ideas there's something incredibly both exciting and impactful in their lives but also let's be honest super ego boosting like like if you want if you want to have a moment where you know yes you're making money but more importantly you feel phenomenal create relationships between people in pursuit of something that they can't achieve on their own what's been your experience with this um I want to just put a pin into the idea of this idea of paying because there's lots of ways to pay and one of them the most convenient one is money but we'll talk about that in a second yeah so on ning uh we built one of the earliest uh big communities you had other than the volunteer firemen which was called tribes with three eyes in the middle of it I'm not sure why it had three eyes in the middle of it but it did but it was cool I like it was it was what 15 years ago probably yep uh a couple months ago begy Becky Blandon who was a core member passed away oh I'm sorry and um I think I met her in real life once maybe but we all heard from each other again 15 years later and um I now run a community called purple. space that has a thousand people but in between uh I built the carbon Almanac with 1900 other people and we were all volunteers it was my full-time job for a year and a half I didn't make a nickel and 90 countries what people paid for there was they had to put in their time or they couldn't be part of it and once we made this commitment to create a 97,000 word book in five months and we did it footnoted and without a significant error what people said is this was transformative it f they found solace and hope in the idea that other people could come together and make magic happen and the thing about the carbon Almanac is it's 97,000 words I only wrote a thousand of the words so I wasn't in charge but I created the conditions for it to happen right and so what we're seeking to do here is find a place sure people should pay you money to be in it but what they're really going to pay is time commitment status it's going to feel risky to them to identify with this thing that is the hard thing to get people to do and when you build one of these communities the tempting thing is to just keep cramming it with content and because then the people who want content will stop whining and you can go back to what you were doing but if you leave a space don't steal the Revelation if there's a ainal space for them to step into so you know one of the guys uh who wrote I think 14 articles in the almanac the first one he wrote was terrible and the second one he wrote he used Ai and and plagiarism and we said don't do that but the third one when he realized he could write transformed him and the book and he just kept writing and it kept getting better and better and better oh wow but but if we had said oh don't worry we'll take care of the writing he would have just been a witness and you need more than that you need participants yeah what I love about that as well is if he had tried to go do or any of the people involved in the Almond Act would have tried to go do it on their own you know this idea of like oh well now especially with AI I can do all of this they would first of all he wouldn't have had the same results and he wouldn't have built the same connections and relationships that allowed him to have those results yeah and I I think what's you know and I really appreciate what you're saying in terms of the the investment people make is not just just money the I I I think that's true I think that what's been so interesting in in kind of my evolution is seeing the the data behind the scenes that that when you have one area of investment there are all of these other areas of investment that show up as well and I think what is so powerful about what you're describing is that there can be now money is certainly the easiest but it's not the only one and I think that that's a super important Point uh and I think the the other thing that I would I would tease out is the power of creating these kinds of new fresh interesting ways of interacting people have never and this is one of the the reasons why I think you know whether it's it's transactional dating sites or other things like networking events even you know people people are the way you create relationships is in the context of a transition of a goal of an interest a passion a a framework that you fall in love with and you want to apply or a transition that you want to make I think the sobriety we some of our most popular Mighty networks are different flavors of sobriety networks and and so sobriety movements but I think one of the things that that I'm really struck by and I'd love for you to to maybe talk a little bit more about this is this when you can bring people together to go on a quest right there is a reason why the most popular stories in the history of people whether that's big Blockbusters or whether that is you know Stories being told over over fires a thousand years ago are about bringing people together to go on a quest and I think you have this incredible history of creating Quests for people how have you thought about it and and and does that resonate or are you're like no no G I think about you're Dro you're dropping so many pearls here uh one so you know let's think about the one of the largest Marathon events in the world the New York City marathon where did it come from was it Mike blo Bloomberg or somebody else who just said let's have a marathon no it was the New York Road Runners Club so the New York Road Runners Club starts as four people four people who just want to run around Central Park why is it better to run with three other people and the answer is because the last mile of a marathon everyone is tired that's not a question no one goes to a running coach and says I want to be able to run a marathon without getting tired that's not an option so what's the difference between someone who quits at Mile 25 and someone who finishes and the answer is they figured out where to put the tired and if you can run with other people the peer pressure will help you learn where to put the tired okay so now there's four of you and then there's eight of you once you've become a runner once you are in a circle like that you will do almost anything to defend your choices so now you will volunteer and give out juice and now you will write the newsletter and now so if you go to the park slope food co-op in Brooklyn there are people who work more than their shift because they don't do the shift because they have to they do the shift because that's what people at the park slope food co-op do and so the identity yeah the identity so what we have in our culture is not a shortage of noise or information or things to buy we don't have a shortage of all sorts of entertainment we have a shortage of meaning and identity and the people who are um you know self-medicating with social media they're doing it because that what they really want is a hug what they really want is to be missed if they are gone yeah and so that's why starting the kind of communities you're talking about is a service it is not self selfish and if you do enough service you'll get paid don't worry about it you'll get paid but you got to figure out how to do enough service first yeah I think about it as um the high I think about social media as the high fucose corn syrup of relationship you know it's like you you think it's feeling good and you think you're getting something the the aha moment I had was there was a couple of people that I was following on social media and a and they were people I had kind of met once or twice but but then I saw them again you know a year later after following them on social and they didn't know me from Adam and yet I knew more about them and I realized that that um disconnect actually was more jarring to me and I realized I just like I don't want to have these parasocial relationships if anything what I want and what I want Mighty to be and what my team wants might to be is a way for you to facilitate and host people building relationships with each other perhaps from an idea perhaps from a you know a the ability to bring people together around a transition or around a goal but that it is the about the relationships that they are making with other members whether that's in the New York Road Runners Club or whether that's in the Park Slope Co-op right then it is about a false relationship with me or anybody else yeah switch of gears for a sec I'm sorry you and I didn't want to interrupt no no no no it's it's I love Switching gears what I was just gonna say was and this is different than what exists on an email list or in a newsletter or in you know in a a social following correct but switch scares okay David Chang the famous chef at Momo fu yeah uh when did David Chang become David Chang because I was there and I will tell you um I don't know the original I feel like we're about to like get like like something that I wouldn't otherwise know just from Reading Please go uh the original Moma Fuko Noodle Bar only seats like a 100 people and before it was a critical darling you could just walk in anytime I live about uh 45 minutes from there and so Saturdays I pile the family into the electric car and we drive down to the uh East Side Lower East Side of Manhattan walk in for lunch and I haven't had meat in 30 or 40 years and so I would order the Brussels sprouts without the bacon please this is a big win for them because they don't have to waste the bacon and it's a win for me because I can eat it right and we'd sit at the counter and do this and the first time it was delicious the second time it was delicious we went the third week and I ordered it and the guy behind the counter and I'm pretty sure it was David I can't be sure but pretty sure David turned to me and he said you know there's a really good vegetarian restaurant Three Doors Down and we have this on our menu the way we have it because that's the way we think it should be so thank you for your support but you shouldn't come back wow and if you're not willing to do that you can't actually build a community you have to be able to say this is if you want to eat in our restaurant you need to wear a suit and a tie if you want to come to the New York philarmonic you're not allowed to cheer in the middle of of a movement right that this is what it's like around here yeah and that doesn't mean you're dictating everything it just means you have to a have standards but B be very clear who's it for and what's it for and one of the challenges of a paid for network is it super tempting you say but yeah but they're going to pay me I know they're going to pay you but what they're really going to pay you with is their energy and their insight and their connection so if you let bullies in if you let in people who are too needy for what the community can offer if you let in people who get satisfaction out of being a troll that's what you're gonna get yeah I one of the things I've observed is that you know those fears of the bully or the the person who's going to come in and troll create something really interesting that that is conventional and I think there's a counterintuitive solution that builds on what you're saying which is so what a lot of people try to do is they try to set guidelines and and like the guidelines are like anything that any of us can think of is the worst thing that could happen in the world so we start with like don't you know don't murder anybody don't say anything you know don't say anything B it it would be like so so from where I'm sitting it's like walking into a party and like you're you're kind of nervous you don't you don't know people you know you don't even know what the culture is yet and all of a sudden it's just like don't do these horrible things and this is it comes from the greatest you know intention but it is the single worst thing that you can do instead the the right way to think about it is or more productive way to think about it is how are you creating the culture and what does the what does the culture of your community have what does it not have right and so you actually can really benefit and we talk about this as creating a magical first experience creating just this opportunity to to give people the right way or the way they're going to get the greatest reward for participating because you're you're actually giving them you're giving them the cheat code to make friends in your community you're giving them the cheat code of of having recognition you you talk about this a lot you know it's like how people um are motivated to get recognition well it's funny because uh and you did you and I did not plan this but I'm I'm I'll just take a moment one of the things that we launched this morning was streaks and we launched streaks so you get actual rewards for coming back every day but this is this is the thing that we're doing that's different that's coming in a in you know about a month is you will be able as the host of the community to create a system of recognition based on the values of your community based on the culture of your community so that somebody who's earned a bunch of points because they've been coming back every day they get to use those points to recognize other members and being able then to recognize other members for being welcoming or being fun or being insightful or being somebody who brings Joy to those around them and so now all of a sudden you're creating the culture of your community because number one you're getting people to come back and and if you get people to come back every day and you have 30 people they're going to IM by definition provide more value and especially if you're not necessarily to to your point you know creating the conditions like a chat that the same five people are dominating all the time like you're you're you're mixing it up a little bit in terms of of the features but this ability to say hey if you come back every day you are a a member in good standing of this community and get to recognize other people and be recognized for the contribution that you're making and I think it's a perfect example of where people pay attention to what they pay for but but paid is what are you investing in so maybe I should even change it people pay attention to what they invest in and they can invest time energy identity money y uh and so thank you for giving me that that opportunity to to um use a really concrete example of something we just built in because yeah it's so the underlying the underlying forces here there are only two things that most people want if you have food and shelter and health most people are only left with two things they're striving for which is affiliation and status and uh what you're building is both yeah affiliation is so a couple months ago I got invited to a fancy W wedding in the Hamptons I don't like weddings I don't like fancy either but how about the Hamptons I don't like the Hamptons because it's both uh so we get there and you had to get in a you parked your car and then there was a golf cart to take you to the wherever and we're waiting for the golf cart it's my wife and I and there's one other guy and he's wearing a tuxedo and I go uh oh because I'm wearing a suit and it's gonna be a long night so then three more people come and all three of them are wearing suits and I could see the guy in The Tuxedo going uh CA we want to wear the right clothes to the wedding we spend an enormous amount of time thinking about stuff like that affiliation am I part of the culture do am I doing what the cool kids are doing peer pressure all of those things inform our whole lives and the other one is status who's up and who's down who did the teacher call on who got into the famous college and it's again a whole long list well the organizer of the community Begins by dispensing those things yeah you are the adjudicator of status and so the magic of the kind of streaks economy you're talking about is now you're delegating some status uh Awards to other people who also get the culture and this goes back thousands of years there's a reason they have Bishops and and Cardinals and all those other things because you move up a hierarchy even if you're not getting a raise because it's a way to earn status from the fact you showed up with affiliation yeah yeah so it's so well said and it's what we what we really wanted to do and this this you know reinforces the point is how do we give the host of a community the way to reinforce the things that bring status right and you know many gamification systems that exist out there are really just about you know the the system decides what those things are like the system decides well if you come back every day or you take this action of doing a post or whatever then that leads you to the leaderboard and then you're going to stay there forever and it's just like no no no no like there has to be a better way if we're going to build more sophisticated communities for more people to take advantage of because the reality is that we're living at a time in a moment where the there are a ton of forces into that high fucose corn syrup way of connecting and this has got to be better deeper and more interesting or else it doesn't work it just doesn't work so as you think about 2025 like what are you excited about what are you you know what what are you excited about what are you focused on what are you paying attention to one of my favorite questions ask people um individual change is always uh uh difficult and challenging yeah cultural change multiplies that because cultural change is widespread and involuntary I think that regardless of how you hope the world will be it's easy to acknowledge that at least for people in uh many parts of North America cultural change is on the agenda yeah and it's a trap to decide that worrying at 3:00 in the morning is going to to fix this problem because it will not it is uh like worrying about gravity it gravity doesn't know you even exist so what to do what to do comes down to the idea that for 100,000 years human beings organized in tribes of people of about 150 and this number dunbar's number is actually hardwired into many people even if you're super popular only 150 people are going to come to your funeral 150 people is the circle of folks that most people can tolerate and social media and pop culture and Walter kronite really threw us for a loop because now it's not 150 people it's not even 150 million people it's everywhere all the time so I don't think it makes sense to shut it off but I do think it makes sense to not make it the focus of your day right so what you do instead what to do instead is to realize just how much extraordinary privilege anybody who has the technology to be watching this has the tools like when I started when you were looking at yoyo dine we were the largest receiver of email in the world at the time and it took an hour and a half for an email to travel across the internet and we had to build our own server instead of spending $19 at MailChimp and on and on and on so just from a technological point of view the fact that I'm talking to my friend Gina 3,000 miles away in high resolution and it's recorded in and we and you know your streamyard subscription cost you what $29 so they're all of these tools and they used to be reserved for a handful of people at Fortune 100 companies and here you can have them and oh the trillion dollars we spent to build AI you can have that too so what I am thinking about is this generational shift that's happening that my generation is taking hands off the wheel and handing it to other people and each generation changes the culture and the tools and the possibility yeah and so yeah if you want to ask me if I'm completely bereth about the climate of course I am I know a lot about it so that makes me bereft right but I can't fix that all by myself what I can do is organize people to cause change to happen right so I've been persistently optimistic about that year after year after year and the fact is many things in our world keep getting better because of that they don't get headlines yeah but they keep getting better because people in networks communicate and organize and cohere and that is the only thing that's ever changed the world yeah I I'm so glad you brought up the 150 the dunar number because this is this is fundamental to I think what what is the shift I'm seeing which is we're still in social media but we're spending it there are more people spending less time there because a community of 30 or 100 or 150 or a thousand people that feels like it's 150 like that's that is that is the people magic that we are spending all of our time energy and resources on which is how do we make the smallest and even the largest yeah the most valuable to an individual because of the people that they are able to meet to nurture a relationship with and what I love about what you're saying as well is one of the things that I think has been sort of lost is this ability for there to be a strong host and supporting technology supporting a strong host who has that vision for what those 150 people can organize around the the reason that they are coming together the vision for what we're going to go create together and it is so overwhelming to pay attention to everything that is going on in the world when everybody not only has a voice but now they have a voice and they are they are flooding the lane yeah and as we see technology evolve we've got to have these Solutions like going into private communities being able to use technology in a different way to make those connections easier to make being able to schedule something easier and then ultimately to create value with fewer people so that there are more and more reasons to stay in these worlds these communities these 150 person groups without feeling like you're missing out on something in in correct because the old social media was just a hack this is human right so I I have a small if it's here where'd it go yep I want to talk about uh a little tactical thing yeah so this is a funnel and uh I love the fact that you have the the prop yeah like you have it like just write right down there you have no idea I got my Jerry Garcia action figure here which I mean that's an obvious one I have the limited edition Seth Goden action figure which you have one of those you're pretty special anyway um people marketers or people call themselves marketers will tell you you need a funnel to grow let's agree that anybody who's serious about this can get 10 folks to join their community if you can't get 10 folks to join your community you've been spending too much time indoors so you can get 10 folks how do you get to a sustainable number well the theory is you put attention in the top of the funnel you promote you buy ads whatever it is and most people drop out but some end up at the bottom converting that word converting right right my proposal is you flip the funnel and make it into a megaphone and it's not a megaphone for you it's a megaphone for your users Y and so what the hard part is is to create a community that's more like Fight Club not the weird parts of Fight Club but the part of Fight Club that was the first rule of Fight Club is you always talk about Fight Club that fight club grew because the people who are in it realized their life would be better if they brought their friends so it is possible to build in fact the much easier to build a community that feels private I don't want to bring anybody on here this is my special place right right but what you need to do if you're Evangelical about it is you need to from the start build a community where people understand that their status their affiliation their standing increases when they can bring in the others because it's good for them and that is how you get from 10 to 100 whether it's a podcast a blog or a community you're never going to grow the way you want to grow by hustling you're going to do it because your users talk about you instead yeah this is the whole concept we talk about as an ambassador culture and how to build an ambassador culture from day one and why you can just start like don't think about all your marketing ads spent like until you have 30 members don't do any of that stuff and 30 people you can start with five and th those five all know enough people to get to 30 relatively quickly and then those 30 become your ambassadors yeah they become the people that are talking about and bringing in new members and this goes to imagine you're not investing the time and effort and energy to try to anticipate all the horrible things people can do but instead you're spending time effort and energy in terms of creating a magical first experience and getting people super excited about the mission the quest that this community together is going to go on to together that was not I didn't say that the best way but anyways that that wasn't a sound bite people um but this ability to create that Quest and that culture where it's like no we we're bringing more and more people into this that is at the very essence of what we are building and what we are constantly looking for because that megaphone is the power of community it's it's grabbing a friend and bringing them in and helping that friend this is one one thought on this and because obviously I spent a lot of time thinking about this topic is it's not about selling something it's not about spamming somebody it's not about you know oh I can mention it once and then I never can mention it again because they didn't respond I don't I don't I don't want to be a bother it's about reframing what you are creating into this is a community that is going to create results and transformation in people's lives how through affiliation or identity and relationships that are going to surround them and create the scaffolding for them to stick with a new practice a new habit a a a pursuit of a goal that requires effort to be rewarding and if I'm not talking about this I am actually there's there are people out there in all nodes of this network that we all live in that are hungry for this that are that they don't know where the solution to their problem is and that if you're not talking about it you are preventing them you're stealing you're stealing you're stealing their opportunity and so that is a different way of looking at it and and at least for me you know it's it's the reason I'm so passionate about saying hey yes I have an offer I have $199 offer that includes your book because I am here to ensure that if there is somebody who is out there because they're curious because they're ambitious or they're struggling to create a business that is going to be meaningful impactful and durable in an age in a moment of rapidly advancing technology that is going to commoditize a lot of things then I got to be out there and I got to make sure that people know about my offer and I need to make sure that it's so good that saying no isn't an option because it's rad and awesome and includes your book so I think that that's actually a really that's a really they had one big asteris though and then I have two slogans to share the B I love that I love that not only is no an option no might be exactly the right thing for yeah many people what's not an option is maybe oh I like that I like that a lot right so if this isn't for if this isn't for you terrific thanks for coming Gan and I are almost done you g for the good part we'll see you later yeah but if if this is the work you want to do then do it or stop wasting your time right it's in or out so the two slogans People Like Us do things like this right people like us do things like this is the definition of culture it begins with who the People Like Us are and that's not about race or social standing it's a mindset people like us you know if you're an endurance Runner you've decided to be People Like Us do things like like this right and so you get to decide what that's going to be you get to pick who the People Like Us are yeah but the second slogan after I wrote tribes came up a lot people said well how do I get my tribe where do I find the people who are going to be in my tribe I'm sorry you don't have a tribe and you will never have a tribe I don't have a tribe what you have is a chance to find a nent tribe A disconnected tribe A Tribe in waiting and and you can narrate for them you could even lead them but they're not yours and the minute you start treating them like they're yours they will leave yeah and so the magic of tribes is that human beings really want to find the others they don't want to find everyone they just want to find their others and your job as a creator of culture and to build a platform with help from Gina's extraordinary team you get to lead for a but it's their tribe not yours I love those and what you also did something that I think is the best part of community which is communities are forgiving communities evolve and and so even as as I'm like yes I I need to go do this and make it so that you know people don't say no and you're like no no no that's not right maybe it's the problem and the In-N-Out what we talked about in terms of the the the David Chang you know this is not the right place for you I am so glad that you challenged me and so I just want to just acknowledge that modeling because that like this communities aren't about being right they they are about learning and being smarter and being in in environments where you can test out ideas and get reactions and be smarter and more sophisticated as a result so I really appreciate that and then the the the the other thing I just want to to to end on is this idea that we own our audience even that term we own our audience what I believe the ultimate end state is is to be able to be a member of a community or a a co-host or leader of a community that is existing without me meaning that when I want to go into it I can and I I can take that energy from it but it does not rely on me to exist yeah and if anything you know my goal is always if I am tired I want to know that I started a party that the people that are going to be in that party for as long as they want to be in that party godspeed I'm gonna enjoy it I'm G to get energy from it I'm going to take what I want out of it and then I'm going to go to bed and I might watch a show before I go to bed I'll be honest so I just want to thank you for you know this conversation your incredible wisdom your incredible awesomeness and I just feel and I I have always felt grateful to know you Seth and you've just reinforced that for me so I thank you I hope everybody sees this amazing man stop stop stop stop stop stop because my ego is big enough that I like it when people say nice things but I gotta tell you what it means to be a professional is to show up when you don't feel like it and I don't think you've felt like it every day for the last 15 years but you keep showing up and you show up with consistency and generosity with transparency building this generative engine and there aren't very many people like you who are building stuff like this online and I am so grateful to know you thank you for saying that I really appreciate it well this has been a Love Fest uh and you know that's what I like I like being a part of one and for everybody who's participated the chat has been amazing thank you guys so much for being here and again this book is fantastic and um especially if you are curious if you are ambitious or you struggling this is a fantastic read uh and we can't wait to get you guys a copy so thank you Seth thank you and I don't know about you guys but like this has been a pretty awesome day for me so far
