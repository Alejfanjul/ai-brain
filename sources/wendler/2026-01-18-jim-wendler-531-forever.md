FOREWORD The approach we take in our quest to reach our personal goals has and always will be one of the most important factors in determining the extent of our success. Regardless of the pursu it, to reach our highest level of personal excellenc e, we must be vigilant in charting our course upon modern scientific truths and the experiences of experts in the field. To live by chance, relying upon intuition and feeling or by programs lacking a scientific basis, will leave us short of our potential and the successes that lay before us. The concept of developing and exhibiting strength is not a modern phenomenon as it has been an aim of man for thousands of years. Traveling across the world through history from the ancient to the modern you can find documen ted references to weight lifting and feats of strength as holding an important and organized place in cu lture. For example, Ancient Chinese documents highlight the growth of organized strength development from the Han in the 3rd century AD all the way through the Qing in the 20th century AD. During this time weightlifting examinations were not only included in the testing of military cadets but the methods were scientifically formalized. Their weights were buil t according to prescribed specifications and their dum bbells and weight bars woul d have not been out of place in our modern gyms. While on the other side of the world ancient Greeks and Romans were dissecting physical exercise in a scientific manner like they did everything else. The Greeks and Romans were well known for breaking down training and studying the different components of effective training such as diet, period ization, recovery time, and type of exercises in order to reach their potential. Whether it be training for war or simply to show who is the strongest, training one's body for strength throug hout history has always been viewed as an art and approached in a scien tific manner in order to reach personal and cul tural goals and maximize the potential of man. Today our modern thinkers are carrying on the tradition of applying a scientific approach but with even greater knowledge about what it takes to reach our pinnacle of strength and power. The knowl edge as to how the human body works related to muscu lar develop ment and strength training is at its height and science is constantly moving forward with new discoveries that makes our potential even greater. For us to reach our individual goals and potentials we must be careful to be intentional about our approach to training and choose a program that is based upon proven scientific knowl edge and experience. During my career as a coach, trainer, and edu cator I have encountered a handful of individuals who I knew would have an impact on the world around them. These individuals possessed the focus, drive, and energy to go beyond the norm in their quest for excelle nce in the pursui t of their goals and dreams. Jim We ndler was one of those individua ls. I met Jim in the summer of his eighth grade year and over time realized that this young man truly desired to reach his potential and was willin g to vii

put in the work to do so. He possessed the same desire that I had to develop and maximize strength, speed, and power for athletics and the pure joy of training. He was extremely goal oriented yet did n't limit his potential with predetermined barriers or the fear of failur e. Although small and inexperi enced, Jim was tenacious in his quest to not only gain pure absolute strength and power but also in developing proper technique and a thorough und erstanding of the science of lifting. As time went on Jim understood the necessity of being intentional in his training and has never looked back. During this period, the early 19 90's, I had become obsessed with discovering the meth ods of the Eastern Europeans because I had witnessed their amazing performances in sport on the world stage. I used to study whatever I could find and once I involved Jim we would spend hours talking about the lifts, schedules of training, period ization, sets and reps, technique, plyometric exer cises, and an ything else we could find related to becoming faster and stronger. We would then implement these sessions charting our successes and failur es so we could adapt them constantly looking for the greatest gains. One of my greatest memories du ring this period of life relates to a time when I served as a hall mon itor du ring basketball games at Wheel ing High School. Jim and I would hang out in the back hallway discussing and planning how to implement what we knew at the time. Although our sources were limited, our intensity and desire was high and we were able to devise some creative and effective workouts that were not common for the day. At this point, I knew then that Jim would continue to pursue his endle ss quest to be stronger, faster, and more explosive but even more so to understand the scientific methodology of the masters of the field and then apply itto his training. Through his lift ing career Jim has done exactly that. He has not only quested to reach his greatest levels of strength and power but has also continued to be a student, an empty cup, in seeking and gathering all of the scientific and experiential knowledge available related to the art of training. Ji m's workouts and training methods are the results of his passion and life's quest to master this art. We shoul d all be thankful for those like Jim who share their expertise as it will serve us in our individ ual quest to master ourselves, reach our goals, and become the best we can be. Study strategy over the years and achieve the spirit of the warrior. Today is victory over yourself of yesterday; tomorrow is your victory over lesser men. -MIYAMOTO MUSASHI JJarre11 Llewellyn viii

INTRODUCTION This book is an addition to the original 5/3/1 book and the Beyond 5/3/1 book. 5/3/1 Forever is meant for those that understand the 5/3/1 program and the basics of how the program works. Many changes have happenend since I developed the program in 2008 but the core principles remain the same. This book has many different programs that I have done myself or have have written for other athletes and lifters. Every single program has been tested and re-tested with one thing in mind: to make you better. The main goal of this book is to give people the tools to program their training in a smart and effi cient way. I'm really tired of the cu rrent crop of "coaches" throwing every kind of training against the wall, screaming "INTENS ITY" and hoping something sticks. A well-bala nced program need not be complex - if your goal is to do "x" there is no reason to do a lot of "y': If you are doing more of "a" then you should be doing less of "b': Its common sense as you have a finite amount of time and energy. If you are a young athlete looking to make yourself better; don't be overwhelemed and do not think you need to do everything at all times. Take small steps each day and keep your head down. Look at your feet move forward. The moment you look up at the horizon is the when you lose your balance and stumble. If you are a young coach and hope to work with athletes at a high level, , programming and volu nteering. Chall enge yourself physically as you should never expect your athletes to do what you have not done. This gives you perspective and respect. Keep your mouth shut and watch/read/ observe and listen. If you've been lifting/training for the past 30+ years and continually find ways to push yourself and keep your teeth sharp, I have a ton of respect for you. We are some of the smartest and dum best people on this earth. Use your experience and knowledge to stay healthy and help others in your community. If you are new to all of this, welcome to the start of the jour ney! Training will transform you, physically and mentall y. It gives back to you and often times, breaks you. If you have the patience and resolve to stick with it, great things can happen. I encourage everyone to find whatever program speaks to you, fits your goals and your life. The best program you will ever do is the one that you bel ieve in. Wrife/Reari/TrfAin - Jim Wendler 201r ix

2 I 5/311 FO RE VER PRINCIPLES DP THE 5/3/I PROGR AM I developed the 5/3/1 program and its principles almost ten years to this writing. And I still bel ieve in the four principles that originally gu ided the program. In fact, these principles have helped gui de me in every area of training. They keep me headed "truth north:' They are the rudder that allo ws me to steer in rough seas. At some point, everyone that is serious about their training has to raise the flag, throw down their sword and exclaim, "This is what I bel ieve in:' I see too many people who are simply floating around, grasping at the latest and greatest and proclaiming all egiance to whatever trend or idea is most popular . Many make a good case and some are worth examining. But at the end of the day, your success is what matters. And if you have strong core principles you can assess the good and the bad, take the good things and apply them to your training. But without principles, you'l l always wander. And you'll shortchange yourself, your progress and your goals. As H.L. Mencken wrote, "Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats:' Perhaps a little dramatic for our pu rposes, but understand that training can be more than jus t squatting and push ing the Prowler. It can help every area of your life: It can help you und erstand the relationship between work and results; bridge the gap between mental and physical strength; and learn how to set, work for and reach goals. And if you can learn the importance of training principles, you may find that similar gui ding principl es for your life can be equally effective. The 5/3/1 program is based on five main principles. Those of you that have read my other books know the first four: Start too light, progress slow, use multi-join t movements and set PRs. The fifth principle, balance, makes the program work for every training goal for sports and for life. PRINCIPLE N9l: START TDD LIGHT Not only does this refer to the training max but to developing a strong base before moving forward. Too many people are trying to do too much too soon. We all know Rome wasn't buil t in a day, and it wasn't buil t in a year either. By starting too light you al low your body and mind to adapt and build a training callou s. Starting light is like performing a flying 40-yard dash; it helps build momentum. The 5/3/1 program is a percentage-based program - the main lifts and the supp lemental lifts are all based on a percentage of your training max. The training max (TM) is not your actual max or your estimated max. The training max is usually 85-90% of your actual max or estimated max. The easiest way to figure your estimated max is to use this formula: weight lifted x number of reps performed x .0333 (this is the constant) + weight lifted. So if you performed 275 for 8 reps: 275 x 8 x .0333 + 275 = 348 We will round up to 350 for simpli city. Your training max will be 80-90% of this number. So 350 x .9 = 315 or 350 x .85 = 295. We will discuss later what training max you shoul d choose. It can be very specific to the 5/3/1 template you will use.

PRINCIP LES OF THE 5/3/1 PROG RAM I 3 The training max is crucial for continued success in the 5/3/1 program. Starting too light is common sense for a beginner lifter; they don't have the mental or physical strength to handle heavier weights. For a more advanced lifter, starting too light gives them an opportunity to keep buil ding their strength base without risk of injur y or stagnation. This principle allows you to use the correct weights, with the correct speed and also allows you to account for good and bad days. PRINCIPLES N�2: PRO GRESS SLOW I did a lot of things correctly when I first started training. Thanks in large part to my father and Darren Llewellyn, I squatted, did clea ns, deadl ifted and ran and jump ed. I played multiple sports and was always competing. I did things all kids who want long-term successful training careers should do. But I made some mistakes too. The biggest mistake I made was trying to fit 4 years of training into 1. 1 wanted it all . And I see this attitude in every single beginner-"le t's find a way to put as much weight on the bar as soon as possible:' While admirable, it's ignorant. It's not looking long term, and I'm not even talking about 20 years. I'm talking 4 or 5 years. Let's say you have a young high school kid who is pretty damn weak. Instead of rushing to add weight to the bar, he should use su b-maximal training to help reinforce form and build strength. He doesn't need to max out every workout. He will still work hard but not so hard that it interferes with the overall training goal. As important as the main barbell work is for this young lifter/athlete is the base he buil ds in other areas. This include s his assistance work, mobil ity, ju mping/ throwing and conditioning/running. Over the course of 1-2 years, the kid will squat, dead lift, and press and do a large amount of jump ing, running, tumbli ng, push-ups, di ps, inverted rows, sit-ups, pull- ups/ch in-ups, face pulls and back raises. And while the best way to buil d a squat is to squat, an overall lack of total body training/ programming experience will limit his development. A wide base include s doing things other than squatting. This is where the other movements, exercises and areas will come into play. In short, buildin g this base correctly will give a young lifter the greatest chance at long-term success. The 5/3/1 program is divided up into cycles. Each cycle is some variation of the following work sets: Week 1 - 65% x 5, 75% x 5, 85% x 5+ Week 2 -70% x 3, 80% x 3, 90% x 3+ Week 3 - 75% x 5, 85% x 3, 95% x 1+ After a cycle, you increase your training max for your squat and deadl ift by ten pounds and your bench press and press by five pounds. Now you are free to increase less than this, but never more. Progressing slow, even for a more advanced lifter allows for more progress over a longer period of time. Plateaus happen very often the stronger you get. Vincent Dizenzo is fond of saying that "the stronger you get, the harder training gets:' By inching forward, day after day, you set yourself up for a new PR. These two principle s, start light and progress slow, work in tandem and need each other to succeed. If you start at the right weights and progress them slowly, you will make faster progress, even in the

4 I 5/3/1 FORE VER short term. Too many people see training as testing. A workout isn't a test. Just because you don't handle maximal weights, day in and day out, doesn't mean you aren't getting stronger. It is the accu mulation of the work you do over time that makes you better. PRINCIPLE N93: USE MULTI-JOINT MOVEMENTS /EXERCISES Just about every single publ ication on serious training will tell you this: use the big, basic movements to get stronger. In the case of the 5/3/1 program, we use the squat, dead lift, press and bench press. While some may add a few lifts to this list, it is hard to argue with. These lifts are efficient - they build great strength in a variety of muscles. They are also great for developing muscle mass. But this idea extends to the other areas of training: we run; pus h/pull sleds for conditioning; perform box jump s, jump s and medicine ball s for speed and power. These are all simple, efficient and effective ways for you to become stronger. And "stronger" doesn't ju st mean adding weight to your squat. It covers other areas as well: mobility and conditioning. A truly strong person is strong in all these areas. And the best way to do this is to not waste your time. Wh ile the fads and trends come and go in this industry, it always comes back to a few basic ideas no matter the end goal. PRINCIPLES N94: SET PERS ONAL REC ORDS (PRS) No matter what level of lifter you are, nothing compares to a personal record. Young lifters set PRs at an alarming rate; their bodies are changing and adapting to the training and the emphasis on eating right. For the most experienced lifter, PRs are harder to come by, and thus, he learns a great appreciation for them. But one must understand that they do not happen all the time. Sometimes you fail. And that's not a sign of getting weaker or that you need to scrap all of your training. The stronger you get, the longer you do this, the harder it becomes; And once you get to this point, there is very little linear progress in the short term of training. Think about your training life as a large graph, representing your progress on the main lifts. If you take many steps back, the line will be a gradual increase from the time you began lifting to the present. Now if you zoom in and look at a small portion of the graph, there will be many peaks and valleys. This is where people spend too much time; they are too worried about today and not about the bigger picture. Don't get too wrapped up when looking at the progress too close-shit happens all the time. Dave Tate once said that "the average life of a 'fitness enthusiast' is around three years, then they move on to something new:' That's okay, we all have a few hobbies we did n't stick with. Just check your basement or closet for some of your failed interests. But perhaps not so coincidentally, three years is also about the time things get really hard with lifting weights and the physical changes and strength gains really slow down. There's nothing wrong with being frustrated with a lack of progress. But if you remain positive in your mission, the big breakthrough will come. I've been working with this one guy for years. He of course made great progress in the beginning. Now, he has a lot of average workouts and he's learned that a

PRI NCI PLES OF THE 5/3/1 PROG RAM I 5 lot of average days end up resulting in a few amazing weeks where he hits huge PRs and smashes bounda ries. That period, of cou rse, is then followed by a whole lot of very average days. It's the average days that result in the paydays, because the longer you do this thing, the more average days you have-along with some very bad days. You have to learn to keep the faith and persevere. As Joey Waters once told me, "The longer I'm stuck, the bigger the payoff:' Every 5/3/1 program gives you the chance to set a PR. It may not be every day, every week or even every training cycle, but if you embrace the work, you will enjoy the success of setting PRs. And a PR is much more than jus t doing a one-rep max: an extra rep or five extra pounds on your 10RM is you getting better and getting stronger; training for and reaching a conditioning challenge is a PR. I want you and others to know the joy of succeed ing from hard work. A PR doesn't always have to be a true personal record. On every PR set, I coach others (and myself) to have a goal for the set. You aren't always going to do better than last time and those days, you must still push the set hard. Prior to your PR set, make sure you have a definitive goal in mind, which may include effort, bar speed and form. Always leave a rep or two in the tank and be sure to stop the set when your form is compromised. Perform every rep as explosively as possible- this has the greatest potential for strength gains. Lower the bar as slowly as needed to maintain great form (and put yourself in the correct position) and ascend as fast as possible while still being under control. "Under control" is the key phrase here. I see too many people, especially dur ing their warm-up, lift the barbell fast but with no control - they look like an out-of-control piston. This is usuall y a result of knowing the idea of "lifting fast" but not understanding the idea of total control. And let's all be honest, if a lifter bench presses 300 pounds, lifting 95 pound s in a slop py, fast manner does nothing to impress others and most importantly, the load is too light to even ill icit strength gains. And the idea of "priming the CNS " with such light weights is ridiculous - that is why we jump , bound and throw heavy objects before training. In other words, there are better ways of achieving this goal. You will never have perfect form when lifting, especiall y dur ing a very hard set. Mark Rip petoe once said, "The perfect is the enemy of the good:' This becomes especially true once you are no longer a beg inner and have built a strong base of strength in your entire body, not jus t a couple of lifts. This is one reason why a lifter or athlete must have a strong base of different skills and training; a balanced, front-loaded approach to all areas of training gives a lifter a better chance at long-term success. PRINCIPL E NqS : BALANCE The newest principle is bala nce. No matter what the lifter's goals or level, training should address at least four areas: strength, mobil ity/flexibil ity, conditioning and recovery. Some athletes will need more areas. And some people will need more of one area. But regardless of the situation, all of these areas have to be part of a program. Balance doesn't mean equal time or equal weight. Rather, balance is about making sure each area doesn't drop off to such a degree that it interferes with your progress. The big problem is that people get pul led in every different direction in regards to balance. There are some people who seem to do nothing but mobility work or do recovery work despite not doing

6 I 5/3/1 FOREVER anything to recover from. Hell, if you belie ve half the shit people write, NO ONE is able to lift unle ss they pass 400 mobility tests. But if you stay with training long enough you'll know an undeniable truth: a little bit goes a long way. 3-5 Air Dyne sessions a week and you'll be in better shape in a couple weeks. Are you stiff and sore? Perform the Agile 8, two times per day. It takes 10 minutes or so to complete each session and in less than two weeks, you'll feel better. So even if you aren't excited to do some of the things, it doesn't require much more than discipline to be committed to your success. And discipline and commit ment require no talent - so there is never an excuse. The four areas that we will try and balance are strength, conditioning, flexibility/mobil ity and recovery. All of these work together. The better condition you are in, the better your recovery and the easier your strength training workouts. Mobility work will allow you to achieve comfortable and strong positions in the main lifts and help you recover better between sessions. The better you recover, the easier your training will become. None of these exist independently, and all of them are essential to your success. WARM-UP/MDBILI TY/FLEXIB ILITY This is done prior to each workout and often done as part of recovery. STREN GTH This consists of various jump s and medicine ball throws, the main lifts, supplemen tal lifts and assis tance work. The main lifts of the 5/3/1 program are the squat, dead lift, bench press and press. Some, not all , of the 5/3/1 programs use supple mental work. This is, generally, barbell work that is the same lift as the main lift or a slight variation. For example, the incline press is a supplemen tal movement of the bench press and press. Assistance work can be multi-joi nt or isolation exercises that help assist the main lifts and supplem ental lifts. Examples are chin-ups, dips and abdominal work. CDN DITIDN ING I generally classify conditioning in two very unscientific categories: easy and hard. Easy conditioning is aerobic work that doesn't affect your strength training. Harder conditioning must be accou nted for in your training and is something that is weighted/heavy and requires a great deal of physical and mental effort. The Prowler and stair/hill sprints are the best examples of hard conditioning. RECO VERY This includes additional mobil ity/movement work, aerobic work as well as diet and sleep. Recovery is essential for every lifter/athlete but not everyone needs to recover from the same amount of work. Generally, the older/more experienced you are, the more recovery comes into play. Als o, the more intense your training (college/ professional athlete) the more recovery becomes essential.

WAR M-U P/MOB ILITY/ FLEXI BI LITY I 7 WARM-UP/M OBILITY /FLEXIBILITY As with everything in the fitness industry, the pendulum swings from side to side. For years, the warm-up prior to training was given bottom bill ing, sometimes not even on the undercard. There was even people writing that you should be ready for "battle;' aka training at all times - we can safely assume that the people that say this are pretty damn weak and slow. Well, of course you don't need much of a warm-up if you only squat 200 pou nds and measure your 100m time with a calendar . Then the pendulum swung to the other side and there are people that barely train yet do a 45-m inute mobil ity session. They think every part of their body must be aligned with their spine AN D the stars prior to even picking up a barbell. As Brad Arnett once told me, "At some point, you are going to need to lift something heavy:' And as always, the answer lies somewhere in the middle . The most important thing about your warm-up and mobil ity work is consistency. Some people may need more work than others but if you consistently do a 10-15 minute warm-up prior to training, that's more than most will ever need. Now if you ignore this for a long time, you may need some more work but like magic, once you catch up you'll only need that small window. It's all about consistency. Common sense tells us the teenager needs less of a warm-up than the 40-year-old lifter who has squatted every week for 25 years. The older lifter has a few more miles on his body, and it takes some time to oil the joi nts. But this doesn't mean the younger lifter abandons the warm-up; if he continues training for his entire life the interest he will build by consistently doing something will last long until his twilight years. And I know there are a lot of older lifters reading this and saying, "Jim is right. If I had given only 10 minutes every day devoted to warming up, things would be very different right now:' So if you are a younger lifter who has ignored this area of training, take some advice from people that have actually done something: start making your warm-up a habit today. Wa rming up doesn't have to include a milli on movements or require a special degree from Harvard. Joe Defranco wrote a simple program called the Agile 8. You perform the following movements prior to training: l IT Band foam roll x 10-15 passes per leg. i! Ad duc tor foam roll x 10-15 passes per leg. 3 Glu te/piriformis myofacsial release; best done with a lacrosse ball or PVC pipe x 30 seconds per side. 4 Rol lovers into "V" sits x 10 reps. S Fire hydrant circles, 10 forward and backward circles with each leg. & Mountain cli mbers x 10 reps. 7 Groiners x 10 reps, holding last rep for 10 seconds. 8 Hip flexor stretch x 3 sets of 10 seconds per leg, perform all reps with one leg before switching to the other.

8 I 5/3/1 FORE VE R If you have any questions about how to do any of these movements, a simple internet search will assist you. Obviously the Ag ile 8 isn't the only warm-up you can do. The key is finding something you will do consistently. I have a general template for warming up and mix/match movements to avoid boredom. I Something to get moving: This is either the Ai rDyne bike, jump rope, Prowler or sled. This usually takes 3-5 minutes and never done in a way to make me tired. Rememb er that this isn't a work out. A jump rope is an inexpensive option and anyone can do it ...: the added benefit is that your footwork might improve. i! Groin/hip s - this is always something done to the side: hurdl e du ck-unders, Cossack squats, side shuffle or side lu nge. 3 Bodyweight movement - usua lly a push-up, pull-up /chin-up , ab wheel or inch worm. 4 Legs/hip flexors - this is usua lly Bu lgarian one leg, squats with a pause at the bottom, spider  mans or some kind of lunge. 5 Shoulder movement - this is usuall y a band pul l-apart or shoulder dislocate. & Squat - fall into a deep squat and hold for 30 seconds. This doesn't usua lly change. Here is the exact warm-up I did this week. Again , you can change/move any of the movements. • Jump rope x 50. • Hu rdle Duck-Under x 5/side. • Push-up x 3, hold bottom position for 3 seconds. • Wa lking lunge x 5 reps/leg. • Band pul l-apart x 20. • Squat x 30 seconds. I did this three times through with an em phasis on control and being as slow as possible. It's not about doing a lot of reps, rather it's about doing the reps slow and doing them correctly. If you don't have access to anything fancy, use some basic cal isthenics and bodyweight movements to warm-up. • Jum ping Jack x 25. • Bodyweight squat x 30 second hold at bottom. • Push-up x 5 (hold bottom position for 3-5 seconds. • Bulgarian one-leg squat x 5/leg (hold bottom position for 5 seconds). • Hang from chin bar x 30 seconds.

Ju MPS/TH ROWS I 9 There is an endle ss su pply of movements you can do. In general, we stay away from anything that is weighted, except for the sled and Prowler. We strive for full range of different movements, especially with the legs. You want to do something for the front (lunge or one-leg squat) and something to the side (hurdle duck-under or Cossack squat) and do some kind of bodyweight squat. We also like to do anything that requires getting on the ground and getting off the ground- push-u ps, roll-overs or very light Turkish get-ups. Bottom line: move in different directions and be slow and controlle d. Anytime you perform a hard conditioning session or lifting session, you should do a warm-up. Don't rush it and don't ignore it - be slow and be consistent. Qual ity beats quantity every single time. JUMPS /T HROW S Few things have received less love in training circles than using various ju mps and medicine ball throws. We ll, let me clari fy that and edi t it to read "popular training circles:' For those of you that were involved in the field events in track, you probably know these very well. I bel ieve· that using ju mps and throws are essential to any total training program, provided they are programmed and performed correctly. Jump s and throws don't need to have a performance goal each training session. Rather, I want you to have a consistency goal. Don't worry too much about how high a box you jump on or how far you throw the ball. Just aim to do some kind of jump or throw before every training session. Besides jus t being fun to do, there is a practical reason to do these before you train. In simple English, performing an explosive exercise prior to training helps "turn your body on'.' Your nervous system gets turned on and gets you ready to lift fast. Now if you grew up training in the 80's and 90's, you most certainly heard of doing this. It made a big splash in athletics and plyometrics became the big buzzword. Of course, people began over using them, abusing them, and as the fitness pendulum swung the other way, pretty soon you weren't allowed to do them until you squatted 8 million pou nds. I swear someone made up a rule that said you could n't do any jump training unless you achieved a squat of twice your bodyweight. This became law for some. For the rest of the people who didn't bite their tongue every time they ate, the realized how silly this rule was. Let's use a 10-year-old kid - he ju mps up and down and runs. He flies off the couch, off play ground equipm ent and off the make shift Pro Wrestl ing ring he and his friends made. Fast forward 2 years later when he begins to lift with his older brother and he is no longer allowed to even swipe at a du st bunny hanging off a ceiling fan. Remember that jump ing on a box is NO T a plyometric movement. Plyometrics involve some kind of stretch or rebound. A simple box jump from a standing position is not plyometrics. To illus trate the difference between the two, here is the best analogy: imagine throwing a ball on top of a box. That is a box jump . Now imagine bouncing that same ball on the ground and bouncing it on top of the box. That is plyometric. So if you step off a box, land and immediately jump on another box; that is a

10 I 5/3/1 FORE VE R plyometric movement (provided you don't spend too much time on the ground). It's a crude analogy but it is easy to imagine. Everyone can jump and throw. If you've been lifting weights, you can hop on a box, and you can toss a medicine ball explosively. This is the best way to learn how to gather your strength and speed (power) and generate it for one pu rpose. It is an amazing teaching tool for coaches of young athletes - there is an immediate goal and you cannot jump onto a reasonably high box slowly. You have to be fast. It is al most dummy proof. Conversely, not everyone should be doing plyometrics, at least not with ju mping. It is incredibly stressful and should be reserved for athletes that NE ED to do them and can do them. For the most part, the average person does not need to do them. There is little reward for such a large risk. This is due to the high amount of stress on the body, namely the calves, knees and ankles. Before we get to the movements and the programming, let's add ress what you should n't do. Ever. RULES DF THROWING AND JUMPING • Don't do high-rep box ju mps or something similar to box jump s. There may be a practical to reason to use high-rep jump s as part of an advanced, specific training program for a specific individual. But I can assure you that it is NOT for getting stronger, getting in better condition or even improving your jump ing abil ity. I'm not sure where this training idea started but it is horri ble . You know when you start dating someone and you have a general list of things that are deal breakers or litmus tests? For example, how one treats his parents or if they ever want kids. Well, high-rep box ju mping is one of my litmus test to determine Training IQ. Not so much for the ones doing it, but the ones that are programming it and getting paid to do so. If high-rep box ju mps were a medical procedu re, it woul d be akin to blood letting to bala nce bodily humors. • Don't do a ju mping movement/exercise that you aren't ready for. You don't need to do a 7-foot depth jump to get better. So do what is appropriate for your skill level. • Don't skip jumping and throwing. You won't ruin your strength doing ju mps and throws prior to training. Appa rently, some people are so out of shape that doing 3 sets of 5 box jump s makes them weaker. If this is you, suck it up and get in better shape. • Don't worry if you can't box jump 18 feet like many popular athletes. This is not about reaching the YouTube Olymp ics, it is about improving your training. • Don't sacrifice explosiveness for weight. Your manliness is not being measured by the weight of the medicine ball you throw. So put down the boulder and use a ball that can be done explo sively. For the majority of males with some strength training background, a 10-12 pound medicine ball will suffice. My general rule is to do 10-20 jump s or throws prior to each training session but this will always change depend ing on what you are doing in the weight room. Each program in this book has my rec ommendations. You can mix/match any combi nation you want. The point of the throws and ju mps

JU MPS/TH ROWS j 11 is to be as explosive as possible so don't turn this into a conditioning session. Make sure you have adequate rest between each throw and jump . Do them right. eax JUMPS Box jump s are the easiest thing to do and probably the least stressful of all ju mps. The only danger is missing the box, which can be prevented by using a dense foam box for jump ing (these are being sold everywhere) or padding the sides/top of part of the box with some carpet and by using some common sense. The one down side to box jump s is that athletes are often limited by hip flexor flexi bil ity - they can't bring their legs up far enough on higher boxes. So while a box jump is an awesome test, it isn't the ultimate test of lower body explosiveness. The box jump is incred ibly easy to perform and is exactly what it sounds like: you jump onto a box. Use your arms as part of the jump (remember ju mps and throws are a total body exercise) and try to land soft. Landing soft is a great way to learn how to be explosive (tight!) and still have a sense of calm and relaxation. Once you land on the box, either step down or jump down. Personally, I like to jump down and stick the landing position and then reset for the next jump . The height of the box doesn't have to be a max jump every time. Nor do you have to go through some height progression from workout to workout - let that come naturally. You want to pick a box that you can make but still requires full effort to get onto. The point of the box jump is not to jump on the highest box possible; rather, it is a way to turn your body on for the lifting session. In general, we usually jump on a box that is approximately 80%-90% of the athlete's best jump or projected best ju mp. This isn't hard to figure out if you are a coach with some experience. If you are a coach or athlete that doesn't have a lot of experience, just start with a low box and progress slowly over a several weeks. You don't have to go crazy when you first begin ju mping, and it's not a good idea to test a box jump max the first day. This is especially true when training younger or weaker athletes. If you are training yourself, think about it this way- you wouldn't try to bench press 500 pounds the first day you come into the weight room. You start with the bar and work up slowly. Use the same common sense approach when ju mping. Remem ber turning on your nervous system isn't separated into up per and lower body. Box ju mps are a great way to prime your body for pressing and bench pressing. So please, let's put the body building away. If doing box jump s exclusively for your jump training, I recommend 3-5 sets of 3-5 reps. You can change the box height between each set, and I always recommend the first sets being lower than the last sets. Aga in, this is jus t common sense. Here is an example of a box jump workout: 3 ju mps - 24" box 3 jump s - 24" box 3 jump s - 30" box 3 set of 3 reps - 36" box

12 I 5/ 3/1 FO RE VE R STANDING LONG JUMPS Like the box jump , there is little confusion as to what this is. Instead of jumping for height, the stand ing long jump is for distance. To perform, start with both feet planted in a comfortable jump position. Swing your arms back naturally and push your hips back and bend your legs. Push forward and up and jump for distance. Be sure to stick the landing after each jump . This means land strong on both feet and don't fall forward or backward. Land with as much knee bend as you need. Stand up and reset for the next jump . If using these exclusively for your jump training, I recommend doing 5 sets of 3 jump s. A good way to add some incentive to each set is to put 2 cones down. The first is where you begin your set of 3. The second cone is where you'd like to land your final jump . This gives you something to shoot for and makes it a bit more competitive with yourself. These can be a bit more stressful than box ju mps due to the impact of the landing. Still the majo rity of people can handle the standing long jump , and it is far from being an advanced movement. STANDING HURDLE JUMPS These are similar to the box jump s, but you jump over a hurdle and land on the ground. This is more stressful than the box jump as the landing is much more stressful. Obviou sly, you don't have to use a hurdle to jump over but it helps - less su rface area at the top gives you much more room to maneu ver. The bigger the top surface, the harder it is to get over. In other words, you have to jump over and across. If you are new to this, limit the work to 3 sets of 3 reps. Once you get used to it, you can use the same protocol as the box jump s. STANDING TRI PLE JUMP This is similar to the standing long jump only with an adde d second and third bound following the first two-footed jump . Bounding is simple: you spend little time on the ground. The ground contact is minimal and you should appear like a rabbit on hot coals. You do not land flat footed when you bound - you only stick the final jump . You must land on the ball s of your feet and keep your body under control. This becomes very tricky if you don't have the balanc e or you out jump your body. Too many people find themselves falling forward when they are bounding and lose a lot of power du ring the transfer. The point is not so much getting distance between each jump but to keep the ground contact minimal. With that being said, you will get more power into the ground the farther you jump . So it becomes a balancing game-l iterall y and figu ratively. When you first try this, aim for shorter jump s and concentrate on minimizing ground contact and keeping your body under control. Be sure to use your arms. Bou nding is when ju mping becomes a bit more stressful to the body, especially the ankles and knees. This is not required for everyone! So don't be ashamed if you stick with the basics and con tinue to do so.

JU MPS/ THRO WS I 13 BO UNDING BOX JUMPS These can be done two ways. First is to set up two boxes. Stand on one box and step off (do not jump off). Land on two feet and jump onto the other box. The boxes shou ld be about 2-3 feet away from each other. You do not land flat footed - land on the balls of your feet and bound onto the box. This will require some practice to get the timing down - and again, be sure to use your arms. Now when you first try this, the box you step off of shoul d be shorter than the box you jump on. For example, step off a 12" box and bound onto a 30" box. The higher the box you step off of the more energy you can absorb and the higher you can jump . However, it becomes infinitely more stressful and very difficu lt. Use this method with caution. The best I did was in high school. 40" box to a 40" box. The second way to do this is to set up 5 boxes in a row, with 2-3 feet between them. Jump onto the first box, stick the land ing, stand up and step off the box. Land and bound onto the second box. Repeat until you stick the final landing. You can vary the box height from box to box. Aga in, this can be very stressful so it is not for everyone. I recommend no more than 15 contacts per session. BO UNDING HURDLE JUMPS These are the most difficult of all the ju mps and I doubt most reading this will ever need to do them. Set up 5 hurdles with appropriate distance between them; you will have to judge the distance based on your own needs. Jump over the first hurdle and bound over the rest, minimizing ground contact. This is incredibly stressful and requires very strong ankles and knees. It also requires a certain rhythm. We did these dur ing the track season with my mentor and discus coach, Darren Llewellyn. These became the staple jump du ring this time, and we worked up to 10 high hurdles. Sometimes I cannot believe the stuff we used to do. But understand that this was not something for beginners-a ll of us did a lot of box ju mping and bounding prior to this. If you can do this, use the same protocol as the box jump s. STANDING OVERHEAD MED ICINE BALL THROWS These can be done with feet parallel to each other (j ump stance) or with either leg forward. Bring the medicine ball over your head, stretch back slightly and with your entire body, throw the ball forward. Be sure to use your entire body when you throw the ball , not just your arms. Using your entire body means that your feet leave the ground. And this should happen with each version of these medicine ball throws. STANDING BAC KWARD MEDIC INE BALL THROWS With your back to the area you want the ball to land, stand with a wide stance. Bring the ball slightly between your legs as you push your hips back and bend your knees slightly. Explosively throw the ball over your head for height and distance. Like all medicine ball movements, your feet will leave the ground. One of the keys to this is to be sure to keep your mid-section strong so you do not fold on the way"down or up. To make this challenging, I like doing these with a partner and having him mark where each ball lands. Just make sure you throw from the same spot and try to beat your previous throw.

14 I 5/3/ 1 FOREVER STANDING MEDI CINE BALL CHEST PASSES These are pretty self-explanatory. You can do these with feet parallel to each other or with either leg in front. The one difference that I preach with the chest pass is to make sure you use your total body to throw the ball. Your feet will and should leave the ground. In fact, many times you will jump forward, much like an abbreviated long jump when doing these. Be strong, be fast and don't make this an up per body exercise. Turn everything on! With the medici ne ball , I like to mix and match all the movements and strive for 15 -20 throws per workout. Do not rush the throws. Don't half-ass your effort. Remem ber that the weight of the medi cine ball for most males should be around 10-12 pounds. We aker athletes should use an appropriate ball for their strength levels- don't let your ego dictate the weight of the ball. Just be sure that you are doing the throws with pu rpose. Your goal should always to be doing 15-20 throws or jump s (or a mixture of each) before each training session. This should happen AFTER your warm-up and before you begin lifting. CO MBI NING JUMPING. THROWING AND LIFTING Combining your weight training with your jum ping and throwing will help make you more explo sive. I was taught this in high school and belie ve most people can use this once their bodies have adapted to consistently jump ing, throwing and lifting. This is something I learned from reading about track and field throwers. They did it, to my knowledge, to help their weight training become more explosive. The idea is that when you combine something explosive with a heavy weight-training movement, you will become more explosive while lifting. First, let's address the notion that your lifting will suffer because of this. As long as you have been lifting consistently, aren't horribly out of shape and have done jum ps/throws consistently, you'll be fine. Or if you are ju st a hardheaded bastard - that works too. I have found that the best way to do this is to use the jum ps/throws during the warm-up sets of your main lift and maybe the first one or two work sets. In general, we just do the box jum ps/throws between the warm-up sets. Be sure that you keep the throws and jump s to no more than 3 reps - this is not a conditioning exercise so don't turn this into a circus sideshow. It is imperative that each of the jum ps/throws/lifts be done with total focus - don't jus t toss the ball or jump on a 2" box. Be fast, be explosive. Here is an example of how to combine lifting and ju mps/throws. Let's say your first work set of dead lifts is 315 pounds. This is how you'd approach it: DEA DLIFT /BOX JUMP S • Wa rm-up/mobil ity/flexibil ity. • Box Jump -3 reps x 24''.

• Deadl ift - 135 x 5 reps . • Box Jump - 3 reps x 30''. • Dead lift - 185 x 5 reps . • Box Jump - 3 reps x 36 ''. • Dead lift - 225 x 3 reps . • Box Jump - 3 reps x 36''. • Deadlift -275 x 3 reps. • Box Jump - 3 reps x 36''. • Deadl ift - First set at 315. ST RENG TH I 15 Now remember that you do not have to use medicine ball throws when you are doing a bench press or press - you can do box ju mps too. It doesn't matter what you choose as these are all total body movements and the point is NO T to "work the muscles" but to prime your body. For example, dur ing the wintertime, we do box jump s while we bench and press; we get the same effect as when we do medicine ball throws. I cannot stress enough the fact muscles don't exist on an island; everything is connected. STR ENGT H Nothing has changed in regards to the main lifts: we still use the squat, deadl ift, bench press and press. If you get strong at these four movements, along with the balance from the other areas, you'll be a strong person. If you are injur ed and cannot use one of these movements, change it. Ju st try to pick something that is in the same category; if you can't press, don't choose a barbell cur l in its place. Choose the incline press or floor press. These alternate lifts take the place of a main lift and are only used when you cannot train a main lift used in the program. SUPPLEMENT AL LIFTS These are always barbell lifts and closely resemble the main lifts. In the 5/3/1 program some popular supple mental programs are Boring But Big, First Set Last, Second Set Last and Boring But Strong. All of these sup plemental programs can be done with one of the main lifts, and they can also be done with an alternate lift. If you use a supple mental lift you must find the correct training max. The only downside to using an alternate lift is some people are horribly impatient and don't want to spend 20 minutes and test that lift and find a training max.

16 I 5/ 311 FORE VE R Below are some suppleme ntal options for each of the main lifts: DEADLIFT SUPPLEMENT AL • Deficit Deadl ift. • Rack Pull. • Pull from Blocks. • Snatch Grip Deadlift. • Fat Bar Deadlift. • Double Overhand Deadlift. • Trap Bar Deadl ift. SQ UAT SUPPLEME NTAL • Front Squat. • Box Squat - variety of different bars can be used as well as the front squat. • Safety Squat Bar. • Manta Ray Squat. BENCH PRESS/PRESS SUPPLEMENT AL • Bench Press done with different grip width. • Incline Press. • Floor Press. • Football Bar Bench Press. • Football Bar Incline Press. • Football Bar Press. • Football Bar Floor Press. • Log Bar Bench Press. • Log Bar Incline Press. • Log Bar Floor Press. • Log Bar Press.

PROGRA MMI NG YO UR TRAI NIN G J 17 Remember that not every 5/3/1 program has a supplemen tal lift. Also remember that there is a fac tion of never-have-beens that love to talk about "finding your weakness" or other some nonsense that helps cover up for the fact that they know shit about training and programming. You can always follow the trail of turds these charlatans leave behind by looking for things like, "front squats will help your deadl ift" and "pause squats are probably the answer!" and people who preach the hip thrust gimmick. I'm actuall y laughing out loud right now. Using a different suppleme ntal exercise has it's place but if you are weak as piss and can't do basic stuff like 10 chin-ups, 20 perfect hanging leg raises, actually perform some kind of mile run without choking on your tongue or clipping your own feet, let's save the bul lshit for later. Until you have some basic level of strength and some kind of fitness level, you don't need anything different. Your weakness is you aren't strong and you aren't in shape. Your weakness is listening to idiots - fix that before you add deficit pulls with chains to help your speed off the floor. People's weak points are rarely muscles. It is almost always their head, their heart or their lack of discipline and/ or consistency. PROGR AMMING YDU ll TRAI NING Depending on your level, we program 3, 4 or 5 cycles in advance. The newer you are to structured training (and training, in general) the longer you can plan in advance. The more advanced you are, the shorter your plan. The Prep Plan will consist of two templates: a Leader template and an Anchor template. There are three different programming models we use: 3 cycles of a Leader template followed by 2 cycles of an Anchor, 2 cycles of a Leader and then 2 cycles of an Anchor and finally 2 cycles of a Leader and 1 cycle of an Anchor. Wh ich model you use will depend on your level and the templates themselves. 3 Leaders/2 Anchors - Used with be ginners and people who are doing the Boring But Big (BBB) and Boring But Strong (BB S) challen ges. I do not recommend this for most people. 2 Leaders/2 Anchors - Beginner, Intermediate 2 Leaders/1 Anchor - Beginner, Intermediate, Adv anced: I recommend this for ju st about every lifter and al most every program (if applic able ). Essentially this gives a lifter/athlete enough time to make progress and evaluate the progress. For example, you can use BBS for two cycles, and then go for PRs in the next cycle. Did your squat and press increase with BBS? Good - now you know you can use this to push your lifts. Did it not work for your bench press? Great! Now you can try some thing new and build again. This is kind of like going through a mini-peak without having to spend six months buil ding up to a max or to see if something works. With the 2/1, we can also make sure that you are using the correct training max for each lift. I see way too many people struggling to hit their work sets with speed, power and strength. Also many of these programs are very difficult and spending more than two cycles will bur n you out and disrupt any progress you make.

18 I 5/3/1 FORE VER So prior to starting a program, figure out your plan. Use your training experience to help you, or jus t try something that is different and/ or fun. The problem most people have with programming their training is they want to do everything on the same level; this is when injur y and overtraining happens. Things need to be in correct proportions for continued success. Training is like building a castle: each day, you lay another brick. This cou ld be done with lifting, jumpin g, throwing, conditioning or recovery work. Brick by brick you slowly build the castle. Each brick is important but the key is eventua lly looking up and seeing that you've buil t a strong castle. So stop this nonsense of trying to build your body, or your goal, in one training day. Train hard but train smart. LEAD ER TEMP LATE • Increase in volume of barbell work, usua lly in the form of suppl emental work. • Less volume of assistance. • Less jump s and throws. • Less hard conditioning. • Emphasis on easy conditioning. ANCHOR TEMP LATE • Decrease in volume of barbell work. • Higher intensity of barbell work. • Increase in assistance work. • More jump s and throws. • More hard conditioning. • Easy conditioning can also be done. Note: Mobi lity and flexibil ity work tends to stay the same regardless of template unless you feel the need to do more. In general, a Leader template is usually higher in volum e for the suppl emental work. An Anchor template will have less total barbell volume but will be more intense (relation to 1RM) or sets will be pushed harder. Because Leader templates have a higher volume of barbell work, the hard conditioning and the assistance work will decrease. You will also do less jum ping and throwing. Easy conditioning will help maintain or improve aerobic levels and help facilitate recovery.

THE DE LOAD /7T H WEEK PROTOCOL j 19 Anchor templates are generall y more intense. Assis tance work, hard conditioning and jump s and throws can increase. But the barbe ll volum e will be lower and you will still do easy conditioning. The majority of programs in this book have both a Leader and Anchor template - all you have to decide is which one you want to do. The gui deline s provided are not always set in stone. There are certain templates that break these rule s, but in general, these guidelin es will serve you well. Please remember that when choosing the templates you must be honest with yourself about your goals, your commitment and what your body can take. Too many people think a template looks great, but the reality is that they aren't able to handle the work. There needs to be some accountabili ty on the lifter for his success. Sometimes following your heart is a good idea but your head should at least be consulted. There is enough variety and variations to choose from, no matter what your goals are. Some are incredibly simple , others much more complex. No matter which program you choose, I only ask that you buy "all in" - to quote Mike from Breaking Bad, "No half measures:' THE DEL OAD /7 Te WEEK PRO TOCO L Another big change to the program is what I've du bbed the ]lh Week Protocol. The reality is that the ]lh Week Protocol is not done every seventh week; it's ju st a name. The ]lh Week Protocol serves three functions: as a deload, a testing week for your training max or the chance to hit a PR. Wher e you are in your training will determine how you use it. The general gu ideline s are: • The ]lh Week Protocol will be used as a deload between the Leader and Ancho r templates. • The ]th Week Protocol will be used for testing your training maxes at the comple tion of both the Leader and Anchor templates. This will ensure that your training maxes are correct for you next round of training. • The ]lh Week Protocol can also be used to shoot for a rep PR, but this is done rarely and only with certain programs. • The ]lh Week Protocol can be used as a delo ad after ANY 5/3/1 cycle, regardless of where you are in the program. This is especially important for older lifters and du ring especially taxing pro grams. This is your responsibil ity. For each of these uses, the ]lh Week Protocol's general setup and percentages will remain the same. What will change are the reps done. This week will be a reduction in overall volume, no supplemen tal work is done and limited assistance work, even when we use the protocol to test our training maxes or shoot for a PR.

20 I 5/ 3/1 FOR EVER The bigge st advantage of the yth Week Protocol is it allows you to know if your training max is correct. There will never be any more questions of having the correct training max. For the original program, we always try to have our training max set at 90% of your actual or estimated lRM . So if you can bench press 300 pounds, your training max (the number you base all your percentages on) would be 270 pou nds. As I've adde d different supplemen tal variations and more volume and even different set/reps for the main lifts, beginning with an 85% training max is often recommended. Everyone that trains in my weight room starts at 80-85% -the prog ress is better and the bar speed is never compromised. I always try to stay between 85-90% for the majority of lifters. In general, the stronger lifters use a much lighter training max; there are some that use as low as 77% but these guys are few and far between. But understand that the training max has nothing to do with your machismo - you must use the training max that best drives your li fts. And after doing this with hundreds of people over the years, the more progress you can make with a lighter training max the better off you will be. After staying with the program for a year or more, you will realize that some lifts need to have a different training max than the others. But if you are still in limb o, use the training maxes that are recommended for each template. 7TH WEEK, TRAINING MAX TEST As a training max testing week, the yth Week Protocol is very simple. We work up to our training max and attempt to get 3-5 reps. If you are shooting for a 90% training max, you want to get at least three reps. If you are shooting for an 85% training max, you need to get five reps. Personally, I riever want these test weeks to be a true 3RM or 5RM; I want the reps to be strong and fast. 70%x5, 80%x5, 90%x5, 100% (TM) x 3-5 With this testing week, there is no excuse to having too heavy of a training max. Even if you get more than five reps for your final set, stay the course. Do not increase more than the normal amount each cycle. These sets do not have to be taken to failur e - as long as you hit 3-5 reps, you can stop the set. Let me make this clear again: You do not increase your training max more if you can do more than five reps. Never. If you are continua lly making progress - don't alter things if you are getting stronger. This is one of the biggest mistakes beginners make; they think a training max has some thing to do with the strength level. It is a tool to help program your training in such a way that allo ws for continuous success. It allows for proper bar speed and allows you to account for the bad days; not every training day is going to be amazing. In fact, the longer you train, the more average days you will have. And you will have a lot of bad days too. There will be days that make you re-examine what you are doing and question your effort. PRS I answer this same question a dozen times a day, "I got 8 reps on my final set at 95%. Shoul d I increase my training max more than the standard five or ten pounds ?" The answer every single time is NO . If you increase your training max more than the allotted amount, the bar speed will suffer, you will plateau quicker and you will bur n out and get weaker. This is common sense! If you are making

THE DEL OAD/ 7T H WEEK PROTOCOL I 21 progress, do not sabotage your own training. Keep pushing forward. Recently I had about 40 high school kids using the Krypteia program. We began the program using 85% of their max in all li fts. After three cycles, half of the kids could do their training max for 15 or more reps. This is common with new lifters (1-5 years) who are new to good programming and work smart/eat well. The solution is to keep inching forward; do not adjust your training max other than the basic 5-10 pounds. If you only do one or two reps at your training max, you must adj ust so that your training max is around 85-90%. In other words, lower your training max. In this case, use the formula for figuring out your estimated max (weight x reps x .0333 + weight) and adjus t your training max to be 85-90% of that. Rememb er that many of the 5/3/1 training programs require a certain training max, many are done with 85% and a few with 80%. Set your training max correctly to ensure progress. Personally, if an athlete or lifter cannot perform at least five strong reps with their training max, I will have them lower it. I have seen way too much success with about an 85% TM for it to be a coincidence. Prior to any Leader template, I recommend you perform a training max test week. 7™ WEEK, DELDA D Used as a deload, you will simply work up to a single (1 rep) at your training max. This is for those of you that feel you need a break and know your training max is correct. 70%x5, 80%x3-5, 90%x1, 100% (TM) x 1 Remember , the reason to del oad is so that you never have to deload. If you are already feeling run down, you are too late. As you get more experienced, you'll know the signs and be able to take a week and_ regroup. This is also a good option for those who know that their training maxes are cor rect and do not need to test them. This de/oad is always used between your Leader and Anchor template. You may choose to use it after any cycle if you feel you need it. 7™ WEEK, PR TEST Used as a PR week, you will work up to your training max and attempt to hit a goal nu mber of reps or a PR. This is a good option for those that use S's progression for much of your training. This is also a great option for athletes that need to keep the majority of their training lighter (to account for all the other phases of training) yet still have a week where they can push and be competitive. 70% x 5, 80% x 5, 90% x 5, 100% (TM) x PR or a goal Now, obviously, if you are shooting for a PR or a goal on this day and you don't hit 3-5 reps, you need to adj ust your training max. There are three options for the ?f.h Week Protocol: two, three or four days/week.

ASSIST ANCE, 7TH WEEK PROTOCOL • Push -25-50 total reps per workout. • Pull -25-50 total reps per workout. • Single Leg/Cor e -25-50 total reps per workout. THE DE LOA D/ 7T H WEEK PROTOCOL I 23 You can always decrease the total amount of reps during this time and/or use less intensive move ments. For example, if you are doing dip s and dumb bell bench press as your "push" movements, switch to triceps pushdo wns. This will give your shoulder s a much-needed break. Assistance work is important but when it stalls or inhibits your main lifts and other facets of training, then you are doing it wrong. Get out of your own way - don't let your assistance fetish derail your goals. CON DITION ING . 7TH WEEK PROTO COL • 3-5 easy days of conditioning. • Conditioning tests can be done. I generally have people avoid doing any hard conditioning unless they wish to do a conditioning test. This is the time to test your mile or attempt your Prowler goal. If you do choose to test, you have to use your best ju dgment on which lifts (if any) to push hard. Obviously , if you are using something like the Prowler or some kind of running test, it's best not to squat too hard the day prior. Even if you do a conditioning test, I still recommend doing some recovery work with easy conditioning on the other days. Don't just sit around; use this time to get your body moving. Remember that recovery work is not a workout - it's there to make you feel better. If this isn't happening, you are doing it wrong. Understand this important point: You will have to reset your training maxes frequently. The longer you've been training, the harder it is to make progress. And this becomes especially true with the press and bench press. So don't get frustrated; simply reset and attack with another strategy. Understand that not every· lift will increase at the same time or at the same level. It's jus t the reality of training. Many of the programs in this book are very tough and may require you to take a deload after each cycle. Don't be so proud or so brainwashed to think you don't need a deload. You can't run your body in the red week after week and not expect something bad to happen. Use your head, and use your experience. If you come to the point where you are too run down to train or you have too many bad days in a row, then that is on you. Plan better, recover better and use the experience to teach you a lesson you won't repeat again. Between every Leader and Anchor Program: 7'h Week Deload Prior to starting new programming: 7'h Week TM Test or 7'h Week PR Test

24 I 5/3/1 FOREVER ASSIST ANCE WOR K One of the great challenges of the 5/3/1 program was developing an assistance program. I wanted something that was structured enough to make programming easier. Still, I wanted enough flexibili ty to al low an individ ual lifter to make choices based on his preferences, his needs and what he has access to in his weight room. With this in mind, I developed a very simple solution; each training day will consists of three categories: push, pull and single leg/core. Each category will be given a set numb er of total reps. The general recommendations for the base 5/3/1 program are: • Push - 50-100 total reps. • Pull - 50-100 total reps. • Single Leg/Core - 50-100 total reps. Now, each template will have specific recommendations for the total amount of reps per category. You can choose to do more or less, but under stand that this has been tested and well thought out. This is not something I came up with on a Monday and pu blished on a Tuesday. I have a specific list of movements per category. You can mix and match any of the movements to hit your total reps for the workout. Using different assistance exercises can add variety to your training; I don't see any problem in changing the exercises from workout to workout. It is the work that matters. However there are exercises that may work better for you or ones that you simply enjoy doing. The key is doing a balanced amount of work. Thus we have the three main categories. From experience, most people have no problem doing dip s, chin-ups, rows and cu rls. They are more than happy to do these until they are blue in the face. Single leg work, hanging leg raises and back raises are another story. Even in the assistance work we strive for balance without having to totally disregard the things you probably want to do. So go ahead and do dip s but don't forget to train the torso too. Understand that you must use common sense to choose the correct assistance exercise for each program. If the program has a lot of squat and deadli ft volume , cut out the lower back work and heavy rows. Instead use face pul ls, band pull -aparts and easier abdominal exercises. Not everything should be "in the red" when you train. ASSIST ANCE WORK, PUSH DI PS Dips are a phenomenal way to develop your triceps, deltoids and pectorals. Not only do they build strength, but they can add a great deal of size, too. Bu ildin g a big press and bench press is often limited by lack of size in the up per body, and dip s will certainly help you there. We ighted dip s are fine too but don't turn this exercise into a low rep movement. While it may have some merit to get traffic on social media websites, you are better off using barbell movements for heavy work. This doesn't

ASSIS TA NCE WO RK I 25 mean you can't load them, but doing heavy triples on dip s is not something I will recommend. I recommend higher reps for this movement, 8+ reps. If you are going to do a 100 reps of dip s in a workout, you can do 50 total reps of weighted dip s and finish off with 50 reps of bodyweight dip s. Not everyone can do dip s. This usuall y stems from shoulder issues, and is more prevalent in older lifters that have done more pressing in a week than most have done in their lives. Dips are like the crazy ex-girlfriend that is amazing in bed; it's fun at the time but you learn that the lasting repercus sions eventually aren't worth the short-lived pleasur e. If doing dips leaves your should ers in such pain that you cannot perform other movements, specifically the main barbell mo vements, then it's time to concede and move onto to something else. I don't recommend doing dips every single workout - I can imagine the amount of men out there who think doing dips every training day will shorten the amount of time until women will finally real ize how amazing they are. We ll, it won't. So save your should ers and do dip s once or twice a week, at most. There are numerous options you can do other than dip s. PU SH-UPS Don't laugh ju st yet. For a while, I cou ldn't do dip s due to shoulder issues and used push-ups in their place. Using a weight vest or chains/p late draped across my back/should ers, the push-ups became an amazing alternative that I bel ieve many have forgotten. Most people are more than strong enough to do bodyweight push-ups, but I still do high-rep sets occasionally with my bodyweight for a change of pace. You can use push-up hand les or Blast Straps/TAX if you are so inclined. One of the best reasons for beginners to do push-ups is to learn how tight they should be when they bench press or press. You can do this by holding the bottom position for 3-5 seconds and not letting your air out. Make sure your shoulder blades are pul led together and your body isn't sagging or A-framing. If you don't know how to. do this, ask a qual ified coach that is strong and has more than a decade of real world experience. That feeling in your upp er back/gl utes (and really all over) is how you should feel when you bench press or press. For practice, you should be able to remain perfectly tight in this position and still be able to relax your mind. You should also be able to stop at any point du ring the eccentric or concentric phase of a push-up and feel where your body is and how it feels. This is all very basic stuff that everyone should be ab le to do. I'm always sur prised at how few people can do 25 straight push-ups; don't be that guy. DU MBBELL PRES S This includes dum bbell bench press, incline press and standing press. Dumbbells are great for assis tance work, but only if you do them correctly. Correctly means using a full range of motion and not cutting it down for the sake of using more weight. Way too many people use dumb bells believing them to be better for "pee development" or whatever nonsense is being thrown at people to abandon the bar bell (or really to write an article so it causes their name to be thrown about on social media and message boards). Unfortunately, cutting the range of motion turns the movement into a modified board press.

26 I 5/3/1 FORE VER TRI CEPS EXTENSIDNS/PUSHD OWNS I'm sure there are a dozen EMG stud ies that show a straight bar is better than rope is better than a V-shaped bar for pushdo wns. I honestly don't think it matters; use the one you want. Bands can also be used and are a great way to get direct triceps work in your home gym. Extensions are an amazing exercise provided they don't hurt your el bows. If you choose to use extensions, my advice is to use the strictest form to decrease the weight that you use. I see way too many people turn an extension into a press; hell, I used to be one of them. FU LL RANGE PLATE RAISE This is a great exercise for your shoulder s and up per back. This is best done with a bump er plate but you can also use the football bar. It's simple: with straight arms, you raise the weight until your arms are over your head. Make sure you pinch your up per back together at the top. This is best done for higher reps and great for those who need to give their shoulder s a break from heavy pressing. ASSIST ANCE WDRK, PULL CHIN-UPS/PU LL-UPS "Chin-ups/Pull-up s" is a catchall term used to describe pullin g your chin over a bar without kicking your legs/torso like an idiot. I cannot recommend enough using a wide variety of grips, bars and implements to do these. You can change grips/ implements each workout or between each set. I recommend using ropes and towels as part of your chin-up training to help improve your grip. Unlike dip s, though, you can do some lower reps on this movement, as it will not negatively affect the strength work done with a barbel l. FAT MAN RO WS AKA INVERTED ROWS This is a great exercise for those of you who cannot do chin-ups, and even for those that can do them. If you are strong enough to do chin-ups, throw on a weighted vest and challenge yourself to some high-rep sets of inverted rows. It is a great change of pace. These are best done with a barbell set in a rack at the appropriate position, a smith machine, or with Blast Straps/TRX Straps. I've even done them in my garage with adjus table dip handles in my squat rack. Whatever you choose to do, make sure your body is taut-no sagging allowed. If you are sagging too much, raise the bar/straps until you can do them correctly. Another great variation of doing chin-ups/pull-up s/i nverted rows is something I did years ago to buil d my volume. I'd do a set number of pul l-ups on a chin bar in a power rack. When I'd reached my goal, I'd place my feet on a barbell that was set up in the rack, in front of my body. I'd call these Cheater Chins. I'd finish off another 10 reps or so with my feet on the barbell . I'm sure there is a name for these, but I'll stick with what I got. Try this option if you suck at pullin g your chin over a stationary bar.

ASSIS TA NCE WO RK I 27 ROWS I personally recommend du mbbell rows over the barbell because of lack of stress on the lower back. You can also use a T-Bar row. Appar ently there are 20 different versions of barbell rows now - it's amazing how compl icated a godd amn row can become. Whatever you choose to do, be sure to treat the barbell row like a "muscle" not a "movement:' What this means is that you are doing the exercise to help strengthen the back and complime nt the main lifts. So don't use the "by any means necessary" form to row the barbell. There is always a time and place for that but not in this program. There are plenty of fine rowing machines out there - Hammer Strength always has great pieces of equip ment for rows. Unfortunately, they don't have the same training effect as the barbell or dumb bell. They are great for buil ding muscle but they have little to no carryover to building a strong dead lift. Beside s buildin g a big, strong back for pressing, barbell and dumb bell rows are a great way to strengthen the lockout on the dead lift. This is training economy at its finest. If I had to choose one kind of row that carries over to most lifts it would be the du mbbell row. For the bench press or the press, it helps build a strong upper back and lats, both of which provide stability and strength in these movements. For the deadlift, the dum bbell row helps with the lockout and maintain ing proper position throughout the lift. For the squat, it helps develop a strong upper back to maintain position and to provide a thick pad of muscle to place the bar on. The real kicker is the grip strength that the dum bbell row develops - essential for the press, bench press and especially the dead lift. This is best developed with higher reps (20-50) using the heaviest weight you can use while maintaining some semblance of proper form. The dumb bell row is a one-stop exercise and training economy at it's finest. CUR LS Coming from an athletic background, I always lifted weights to be better on the field or the track. It was never for cosmetic reasons. Thus, I never gave the curl any time in my training. However, curls are still important in this program for balance. There is a lot of pressing in this program and curls help balance that and are also a great way to prevent a shoulder injury. The body doesn't exist in separate pieces, despite what popular magazines tell you. It's all a big system, and curls aren't jus t for bodybuilders. Strong arms are important so don't neglect curls. You don't have to be a curl champion either. These can be done with a barbell, dumb bell, or any of the million bars/cables or machines that someone has invented to do curls. LAT PULLDOWN Once chin-ups/pu ll:up s started getting all the love in the "fitness press:' lat pul ldown were relegated to the sideline and shamed for being second-best. Lat pul ldowns are fine - the big problem with them is that you need a specialized machine to do them. You can do chin-ups/ pull-up s jus t about anywhere, thus they are much easier to program. There are probably hundreds of different machines and attachments to use when performing the lat pull down. They are all fine. I still recommend chin-ups/pu ll-up s, rows and inverted rows over pul ldowns. But they do work.

28 I 5/3/1 FOREVER BAND PULL-APARTS This exercise wins the award for "Most Boring but Effective Exercise:' I've seen way too many people fix their shoulder pr?blems by doing band pu ll-a parts; either daily or every training day. Doing band pu ll-a parts every day (or training day) can fix a lot of problems. Not all, mind you. Most people do pul l-aparts with a mini-band, monster mini-band, or a light band. What band you use doesn't reall y matter. Make sure you are using a full range of motion and holding the "top posi tion" - your arms outstretched to your sides. I like to use different angles but I think this might be me fighting boredom. These can be done on your off days and are great when you are performing your warm-up sets of bench press and press. FACE PUL LS Face pulls are very similar to band pul l-a parts but a little more intensive. These are a row done to the face/head. I once saw an article detailing how to do a face pull; it's like having to teach someone how to push a sled. The face pull is not a movement you are trying to max out on or set some kind of PR. Lots of reps and don't be an idiot: that is the Face Pull Mantra. Face pulls can be done with a band or any kind of cable machine/attachment. These are a great exercise to do in a home gym; you can attach a band to the chin-up bar (or something similar ). If your shoulder s hurt, you can always do sled face pull s - the lack of eccentric phase can be a bless ing for your shoul ders. REAR LATE RALS These can be done with plates, du mbbells or cables. These are best done for higher reps with fairly strict form and are in the same "class" as face pull s and band pull -a parts. Let's not waste any more space on this movement. UPRIGHT ROW Like the leg extension, the up right row has been vilified by every fitness expert, even those with no experience or credentials that would qual ify them to make this statement. Seems like there are a lot of physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons trolling around the internet. Lucky for us, they have extra time on their hands and are willing to dispense advice without seeing someone in person, all under the gui se of "Mass4E ver:' Who needs social ized health care when the internet can properly diagnose and treat most health issues? · The up right row is far from a perfect movement, but people have done them forever without a prob lem; although some people do have a problem. Seems like you should make the choice; freedom is always a great thing for smart, pro-active people who take responsibility for what they do and what happens to them. These can be done with a barbe ll or any cable attachment attached to a low pul ley. These are great for building large traps but not su re if they carry over to anything significant.

ASSI ST ANCE WO RK I 29 SHRUGS Despite my love for large traps, I'm not a huge fan of shrugs, but I recognize their use. These can be done sloppy, strict and with a variety of implements: barbell, trap bar, dumbb ells, or kettlebells. When I use the term "sloppy" please understand that it still means the shoulders move up and down - there should be a noticeable movement. Don't just move your head like a chicken pecking for food. You know these people, perhaps you are the aforementioned chicken; whatever the case, stop it. Everyone is laughing at you. ASSI STANCE WORK. SIN GLE .LEG/CORE BACK RAISES OR REVERSE HY PEREXTENSIONS Despite the trends today of ignoring any direct lower back work, I still believe one must do more than squat and dead lift to strengthen the lower back. The average person who just wants to get a little stron ger and be more "fit" probably doesn't need more. But there is no way you are reading this book and looking to be more "fit:' There are plenty of lifters out there that have hurt or injur ed their backs despite being strong. Of course many of these instances are inevitable -y ou lift big weights and get an inch out of position, shit happens. But many of the inju ries occur when picking up a plate or doing something outside the weight room. The back raise and reverse hyperextension (RH) is a way of minimizing this risk while also strengthening your squat and pull. The back raise/RH allow you to train at higher rep ranges that are rarely touched in a strength training program. So not only are you strengthening your back with heavy, low rep movements with the dead lift, but you are also using high-rep work. Both of these movements are also great for the hamstrings and glutes. Again , remember why you are doing what you are doing. Don't jus t do the movement and be done with it. Focus on your lower back, gl utes and hamstrings - make them do the work. If you don't have access to a reverse hyper extension machine, I have reluctantly made due with using 20-pound ankle weights and lying on my kitchen counter. Back raises can be done ju st about anywhere; the 45-deg ree back raise is also acceptable and easier to use and load. GLUTE HAM RAISE In order to do a proper glu te ham raise, you need a specialized piece of equip ment. These are a great way of strengthening your lower back, hamstrings and glutes without having a barbell in your hands or on your back. There is also a "Natural Gl ute Ham Raise" or a "Nordic Glu te Ham Raise" that can be done in any gym. This option isn't terribly comfortable and can stress the knees and the back of the knees - but it is an option. STRAIGHT LEG DE ADLIFT (SLD L)/GOOD MORNING (GM) These are two great movements to help strengthen the low back, gl utes and hamstrings. However, too many people do these and turn them into a main movement instead of using proper form. They drop their hips, use their legs or cut the range of motion. You are better off using less weight and proper form - this is an assistance movement, not a powerlifting contest.

30 I 5/3/1 FOREVER Remem ber that you are using the SLDL and GM as an assistance movement, not a main or supp le mental lift. So if you get too sore from these lifts, you did it wrong. In fact, if you get too sore from any assistance work, you are either really out of shape or doing it wrong. ABD OMI NAL WORK (VARIO US) There are hu ndreds of different abdominal movements out there. So I'm not going to bother to list them al l. But like the comments above about the back raise, I bel ieve that a serious strength athlete needs direct abdominal work. I have seen way toC? many people add in direct abdom inal work and increase their lifts for it to be a coincide nce. I also believe the major ity of strength athletes need to focus on higher reps (or at least longer sets with slower reps) for the abdominal work. If I had to pick two movements that most people are familiar with and that are incred ibl y effective, I'd choose the ab wheel and the hanging leg raise. If you have bad should ers, pur chase some leg raise straps that attach to a chin bar and save yourself the pain. The ab wheel is also great when using a weight vest. Whatever movements you choose, don't ignore this. I see way too many soft stomachs and weak lower backs in lifting today - build your mi dsection so that it is bulle tproof. Years ago I heard a throws coach speak about training for his jav elin throwers. In the course of the Q&A someone had asked him about abdom inal work, and he mentioned that it is expected for them to perform 50 hanging straight leg raises as part of their training. This was expected ! The torso strength of the throwing athletes is usua lly pretty damn amazing, and it is not a coincidence that they are also incredibly powerful. SING LE LE G MOVE MENTS I'm going to lump all the most popular single leg movements together: step-up s, lunge variations and single leg squats (commonly known as Bulgarian one leg squats). Each of these can be done with various implements: barbe ll, dum bbell, kettlebell and a weight vest. There is no "best single leg movement:' Every so often I read an article detailing the reasons why a reverse lunge is better than a walking lu nge, and two things go through my mind. First, "why the hell am I reading an article about lunges?" And second, "it's a goddamn lunge, who cares?" So don't get caught up in the noise. The one thing that holds true for all of these movements is to focus on the form and execution, not the weight. As soon as the weight becomes too heavy, the form gets compromised...:·-with short steps on lu nges and Bulgarian squats and step-ups that become a double leg movement. Feel free to challenge yourself on these movements, but not at the expense of losing the benefit of the movement itself. KETT LEBELLS/SWIN G HAND LE Kettlebells are a great tool, but I would never consider them to be essential for anyone looking to be strong, fast, explosive and conditioned. In the early 200 0's the kettlebell made a comeback and promised everything: strength, speed, conditioning and fat loss. And while they may have del ivered

ASS IS TANCE WORK j 31 to the general public (to be fair, ANY physical activity for the general public will make a difference), the seasoned athletes and lifters knew differently. It's hard to bull shit people that have been "in the trenches" for years. Like every fitness trend that catches on, the kettlebell had zealous followers, willing to strike down any opponent and take to heart any criticism. This is seen in any fitness trend; untrained people get some results and swear they found gold. ''To the stake with non-believers! How dare you question our God !" As with anything, time gives perspective, and kettlebells do have their place - in assistance work. I recommend doing the KB swing (which can also be done with a T-Hand le), KB clean and KB snatch. You can do these with a single or double KB, and much of this depends on what you have access to. While you need to get used to the form a bit, if you have an ounce of athleticism and some strength, all of this will be easy. Again , an awesome tool, but the barbell, for strength, is still the king and always will be. FARMER WALK I like the farmer walk and think it can be a great way to build your back, grip and core strength. Notice that I did n't mention "conditioning:' Using the farmer's walk as conditioning is mostly a bad idea being perpetrated by uneduc ated lifters who don't have the benefit of experience or even a brain. For an advanced lifter, it can be done for strength and conditioning. For a beginner who lacks the physical background to even stand up with a barbell and put it back down, it is a horrible idea. Asking someone to walk with a heavy weight, while fatigued, when his body is barely conditioned to do a sit-up is asking for trouble. People love the exercise and I get it - it is fun to do and looks pretty cool. Used properly, I think it has merit. Used inappropriately, and I think its ridiculo us. There are plenty of other ways to do heavy, weighted conditioning for inexperienced lifters and carrying a heavy weight is not one of them. Ge nerally, the farmer walk is done for 240-400 total yards in a workout. The �eight doesn't have to be drastic to get a positive effect and to make progress. DB SO UAT Also known as a Goblet Squat, this movement is good for beginners and for those that are specifi cally doing the Krypteia program. NECK I always do some neck work after each training session and I don't count this in any specific assis tance category - it ju st exists by itself. If you have access to a 4-way neck machine, get on it and use it. But gyms that have those are few and far between so let's stick with the two easiest movements to do: neck extension and neck flexion.

32 I 5/3/1 FORE VER Neck extension is best done with a neck harness; they are inexpensive and easy to bring with you to the gym. I'm not going to explain how to do a neck harness as it's pretty straightforward. Use a light enough weight to use a full range of motion. Neck flexion is best done with your head off of a bench - simply lie down on a bench a11d scoot down until your head is hanging off the side. Place a plate on your forehead, and keep it steady using your hands. I recommend a folded up towel or shirt between your forehead and the plate. From here, raise and lower your head. With both extension and flexion, it's best to keep the reps fairly high and to keep the volume low until you've gotten used to the movements. Sleepi ng with a tight/fatigue d neck is horrible. So take it slow and build up over time. Neck work is not essential for most people, but if you play any contact sport or jus t want to look stronger, neck work is recommended. In general, I recommend 50-100 total reps per workout. ASSIS TANCE WORK. EXAMPLE In general, I recommend only choosing one or two exercises per category, per workout. Obvious ly, some movements are better done for a higher total amount of reps. If your program call s for 50-100 total reps of pullin g, you might perform 25 total reps of weighted chins and 75 total reps of face pull s. For single leg/cor e work, you can combine leg raises (30 total reps) with KB swings {50 total reps). Some 5/3/1 templates are harder than others, so it's best to choose assistance work that is easier to recover from, such as bodyweight work and things such as face pull s and band pul l-a parts. If the template is easier and you are doing less supple mental work, feel free to use assistance movements that may challenge you. What I'm asking for is this: use some common sense. BOD YWEIGHT ASSISTANCE I am a huge fan of using bodyweight movements for assistance work. On their own, bodyweight assistance work is limiting. Bodyweight-only proponents like to sel l you that anyone can get big and strong using push-ups and their brethren. They often cite Hershel Walker and Olympic gymnasts as their examples - but Wa lker played pro-football and won the Heisman. Olym pic gymnasts are in the Olym pics. So let's not use the exception to prove the rule. However, bodyweight work as assistance when used as part of a bala nced program of barbell training, jum ping, throwing, mobil ity work and conditioning-b ecomes another animal. One reason why I like bodyweight assistance work is that it allows a lifter to get more volume in his training without much harm to his joi nts. One can recover much faster from bodyweight work than barbell training. Of course, this becomes an issue if the lifter uses crappy form; jus t watch someone doing half-rep pushup s or using excessive momentum dur ing a chin-up/pu ll-up . It is a joke. If you want to get something out of an exercise, do it right. So do your push-ups and dip s with a full range of motion, pausing at the top and bottom for a second. Don't flail around like an idiot when you hang from a bar - you aren't impressing anyone with your self-destructive lifting.

ASSI ST ANCE WORK I 33 Bodyweight assistance work can also act as a marker for strength and (for the lack of a better term) fitness levels. For example, expecting someone to perform 10 chin-ups/pull-u ps, 25 push-u ps, 15 dip s and 10 hanging leg raises isn't asking for much; how many times have you seen someone ask for a specialized squat plan or who can't figure out why his dead lift is stuck yet can't perform these very basic physical tasks? If a lifter doesn't have the strength to lift his legs to a chin bar for 10 slow, consecutive reps he doesn't have the basic abdominal strength to get him very far in the main lifts. If he can't do 20 back raises, do you really think it's his lack of front squats that are imped ing his dead lift? So cover the basics before you even think about moving on to something more advanced. Bodyweight work is not sexy, and it's much more fun to think that your weakness is something specific, not general. But the fact remains that many of us, myself inclu ded, often ignore the basics and what is important. You can have all the fancy plays in football and have the latest "can't miss" prospects, but if you don't block, tackle and hold onto the ball, you aren't going to get very far. Bodyweight work, along with the various conditioning goals, ensures that your training and diet are balanced. It's hard to get fatter and still maintain great levels of conditioning and relative strength. I like to measure bodyweight strength with more than jus t an all -out set. We use 10-minute tests for dip s, chin-ups/pu ll-ups, push-ups and hanging leg raises. The test is simple: do as many reps of a given exercise in 10 minutes. The standards are not terribly high but should give people an idea of their relative strength. Don't be dismayed if these standards, at this time, are out of reach. That is why you train: to get better. These standards are for men. 100 r5 50 50 These tests can be done at any point in your training, but use some common sense. If you are per forming a heavy bench workout on Tuesday, don't do a push-up test on Monday. I recommend only doing one dur ing a workout. You don't have to do a test every single time, use your training to help build your strength and test every couple of weeks. From a coaching perspective, a 10-mi nute test will fuel the competitive spirit of the athletes and make up for what may be a boring training session. In a team setting, this would be ideal at the end of a training session. Understand that if you are a weaker lifter, bodyweight assistance work should not be your only choice. You should still use du mbbel ls, kettlebells and do face pull s- all the cool stuff that everyone talks about. But don't ignore bodyweight work and resort to thinking about weak points until you have great relative strength. For the push-u ps, dip s, chin-ups and pull-up s, I also have a 10-mi nute test done with a weight vest of 10% and 20% of bodyweight. This is great for those of you who need more of a challenge. The goal is

34 I 5/3/1 FORE VER simple - reach the numbers above with 20% of bodyweight added into weight vest. If a 200-pound man can knock out more than 75 di ps with 40 pou nds in 10 minutes, he's going to be on his way to being pretty damn strong. Training and assistance work does not need to be complicated, nor does it need to be all isolation movements. If you are like me, you ju st want to be strong and be able to "hold your own:' Stick with the basics, add in a weight vest when appropriate and you'll never be weak and you'll never lose your way.

36 I 5/3/1 FOREVER IN THE BE GINNING For the last few years, I have been able to work with a large group of normal people. In other words, none of these people deadl ifted 500 pounds at 13 years old. Of all these people, only one had been training seriously for more than 5 years. This has been a welcomed change for me as I'm at the point of my life that I want to give back to others. The point of the Beg inning Workout is simple: build a foundation. While lifting weights and getting stronger is a good thing, we are looking at a much bigger picture. I call it "Getting a Classical Training Education: ' Think about it like this: a young student that starts with an education of different science disciplines, mathematics, history, art, music, grammar, rhetoric, literature and physical culture is much better off tackling a variety of different jobs and challenges than a person who simply studie s one thing. A healthy, educa ted person who has the power to absorb, think, understand and apply is someone who has a great chance at being successful in whatever pursuit he may want. For some, this is the most dangerous person in the world. And it makes many of us wonder where the public edu cation system is getting their ideas for their odd curriculum choices. But that is a topic that should be reserved for another time. The training world is divided into factions: strength, cardio, mobil ity, speed, kettlebell and a bunch of people that champion the latest training gadget or trend that gets hold of the public 's interest. There are thousands of experts with millions of followers, and all bel ieve they are right. And in some ways, they are. The average person usua lly needs to just get out and do something. Our bodies have de-evolved as our world has evolved. And it's simple as to why: most of us don't require a strong body to work at a computer. So the fact that people are doing SOM ETH ING is usua lly better than nothing-for the average person. However, for the rest of us that bel ieve there is beauty in having a strong body and mind, "just doing something" is not good enough. And the truth is that "something;' while being better than nothing, doesn't excuse the crap that is being spewed and marketed as fitness. At some point, there has to be some accou ntabil ity to the things that are doing more harm than good. So while many of the factions have some grains of wisdom, others as so far out of the bounds of common sense that part of me views it as Darwinism. The key to a classical training. education is to take the grains of truth from different factions and combine them, intelligently, to give you the best chance at success no matter your pursu it. I firmly bel ieve that once you get to your specia lty or your "training major:' having a large amount of expe-. rience in other fields of training will serve you. To make it simple, your body will have many skill s to draw from. Your toolbox of ideas and experience will grow. You will be better equip ped to handle training plateaus. Now of course there are outliers, the Tiger Woods of the training world. But never use the exception to prove the rule. Special ization in training should be reserved after a decade or even more of clas sical training.

IN THE BE GINNI NG I 37 I usuall y refer to classical training as athlete training. Now I have deep roots in training for football, but I have also trained for other sports. And I have trained OTHERS for different sports. And while each sport requires different skills on the field/c ourt, the physical needs are.quite similar. I've done dozens and dozens of seminars and the same questions seem to pop up ab out training athletes. For example, let's say a person has a child that plays basketball and the parent wants his kid to get better. I usua lly say something like this: "Basketball is a unique sport. It requires strong hips, legs, midsection and shoul ders and arms. It requires you to be in good shape, be fast and be explosive. It requires good footwork and total body awareness. This is much different than football, which requires strong hips, legs, midsection and shoulders and arms. It requires you to be in good shape, be fast and be explosive. It requires good footwork and total body awareness. It sou nds like your son needs specialized training for a basketball player:' The point is an athlete, in general, requires the same basic things from sport to sport. When an athlete is under the same physical preparation system for many years, things can be special ized for his or her needs. However, very few athletes are in a system long enough to do this. To add more fuel to my point, few athletes are in a system with the long-term training result in mind. High school coaches, while I understand their plight, are not equi pped with enough training knowledge or the facilities to train their athletes. Often times, the youngest coach is used to monitor the weight room and workouts are posted on the weight room bul letin board. Let me make this clear: this is not an indictment of these coaches as they are doing their best. But if you put me in classroom and expect me to teach chemistry, my only answer is to put on a movie with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly and explain, "Their par tnership is true chemistry:' At the college level, things are certainly better. Though the coaches are better equi pped and knowl edgeable, they are poorly outnum bered and answer to too many coaches with a lot of opinions and none of the experience. It's similar to having the politicians running a war, a very dangerous problem to have. But at least, for the most part, the athletes are given 4-5 years of progressive training usua lly under the same system. While this is never perfect, this is what we are shooting for. I will admit that this style of training is not perfect, but I tried to intell igently combine different ideas and protocol into an entire training program. The problem with combining different ideas and approaches into a training program is that, too often, everything becomes important. And with that comes lack of balance. Too many times people equate bala nce to the time being spent on the activity. One hour of lifting weights should be bala nced with one hour of stretching with one hour of conditioning and so forth. This is what is known as Rea lly Fucking Stupid Training. I'm not positive, but I bel ieve Zatsiorsky coined that term. Combining these things into an intell igent program is like making a good stew. You don't just throw a pound of meat, a pound of vegetables, a pound of salt and a pound of carrots and expect it taste good. You have to proportion things correctly. It's not a hard concept to grasp.

38 I 5/3/1 FORE VER BE lilNNll PRI P SC HO OL I have a great home gym. My garage is my dedica ted training place. It has a platform, Monolift, bench press, chin/dip /squat stand combo and a huge variety of bars and gadgets and other things that make this the ultimate home gym for someone serious about strength training. My wife also trains there, and hopefully my kids will one day too. But in the last few years, I have opened up the gym to some local kids, and the results have been outstanding. I have a soft spot for high school kids, as this is when I learned all about training. Al so, I had a great mentor and was lucky enough to recognize the opportunity it gave me. As best as I can, I want to give these kids the same opportunity. No matter who comes here, no matter what level, we work to get.to a very basic level of fitness. This includes mobil ity, strength, jumping and conditioning. The strength portion is not about benching or squatting a certain number. It's about the ab ility to do the appropriate work-so don't get too con cerned jus t yet that you have to squat 500 pounds before I recommend you move on. Once we achieve this level, I know that the person can handle ju st about any training challenge or variation. In other words, we are building a base that allows us to move on properly. But until then, we keep working and pounding away. In general, the kids lift three times per week. This is usua lly due to practices, school, activities and the life of a high school kid. Also, I know everyone can commit to three days a week lifting in the gym, while they train other areas on their own. We divide the training into an A and a B workout that they rotate each training day. This allo ws us a great amount of flexibil ity in schedul ing. Training revolves around four things: jump ing, lifting, running and cali sthenics. This program is as basic as it gets, but you'd be su rprised at how many people need this, adu lts inclu ded. C:ALISTHE NIC:S WARM-UP For the beginner, a simple warm-up using all bodyweight movements works well. Jump ing jacks -3 sets of 25 reps Bodyweight squat -3 sets of 10 reps Mountain climb ers -3 sets of 10 reps/leg The key to these is not rushing through them. You should do the jumping jacks with arms as straight as possibl e. The bodyweight squat should be as low as you can go. The mountain climb ers must be done with huge strides. Remember it's not about just doing it, it's about doing it right. These shou ld be done as a circuit prior to every training session. So you do one set of jum ping jacks followed by one set of bodyweight squats then one set of mountain climb ers. Do this a total of three times. JUMPING After the warm-up you begin your ju mping routine. I recommend one of two things: the box jump or the standing long ju mp. The focus on these jump s is using your total body (arms!) and landing

BEGINNER PREP SCHOOL I 39 strong. We always do about 10-20 jump s per workout. You want to keep this as basic as possible and only have them do what they can handle. In other words, depth jump s are not advised. LIFTING We use two main workouts with this program, an A workout and a B workout. Each day has two main lifts, each with its separate supp lemental work. We then perform some assistance work, usu all y bodyweight or something similar. This template helps develop great form on the main lifts and includes some add itional volume to reinforce and strengthen the body and develop relative body strength. Once one of my lifters is solid with his technique in the lifts, I will test him carefully in each lift. We will work up slowly doing sets of 5 reps. In general, this is done by using 5-10% ju mps of what I bel ieve his one-rep max {or something close) to be. All you have to do is make a jus t-barely-out-of-high school gue ss. So in general, you will use 5,10, 15, 20, or 25 pound increments. Just be smart, and use your best ju dgment. You don't have to wait until he misses -I use bar speed or a blatant technical breakdown as a stopping point. From there, we generally use about a training max (TM) of 85-90%-use the formula for finding the lifter's estimated max (weight lifted x number of reps performed x .0333 + weight lifted) then take 85-90% of that for the TM. For the stronger lifts, where the lifter is either more experienced but still a beginner, we use 90%. For the lifts that they either struggle with in terms of weight or form, we use 85% for a TM. This allows the lifter to use some lighter weights while correcting his form.

Between the main work of the squat, we usu all y do push-ups. And no, this won't make you weaker in the bench press. This is about getting your body ready for battle, so to speak. During the supple men tal work (in this case, it's First Set Last), we will do another bodyweight movement such as sit-ups, chin-ups or inverted rows or perform face pull s or band pul l-aparts. The key is to keep moving. None of this is to failur e or is going to make a dent in the barbell lift - but it does add up over time. WORKOUT B DE ADLIFT /PRESS Week 1 - 70% x 5, 80% x 5, 90% x 5, 5 sets of 5 reps @ 70% Week 2 - 65% x 5, 75% x 5, 85% x 5, 5 sets of 5 reps @ 65% Week 3 - 75% x 5, 85% x 5, 95% x 5, 5 sets of 5 reps @ 75% There is no difference between the sets/reps of the two days. However, we have found that, for the weaker lifts (the ones that you are using an 85% TM), we will do Second Set Last as the supplemen tal work. We do the same sets and reps (5 sets of 5 reps). The main thing I'm looking for is crisp bar speed and good form.

BEGINNER PREP SCHOOL I 41 I'm not a form Nazi, nor do I think a lift needs to be done one way. We have kids who are better high bar squatters, some who are better low bar squ atters and another who only uses the box squat. The bar speed will always be an issue in the beginning, as they are just learning how to push hard. Eventually they learn to be strong, fast and under total control. It just takes some time and constant reminders, every single rep and set. The entire point is that there are quali ty reps, not jus t a bunc h of reps. I can't stress this idea enough. For the sake of learning the movements and learning how to do them with QUALI TY, I'd much rather have them do 5 great reps than 10 shitty ones. And no one can make an "easy" set of 10 reps look worse than someone who hasn't learned how to 5 great reps. I know everyone wants to lift 12 times a week, but for what we are doing, a total balanced program that involves running, jump ing, lifting and cal isthenics, three days of lifting is enough. I can say this because I have trained jus t about everyone that comes here like this and all of them have made huge leaps. In fact, we had one kid come in one year, improve his squat from 95x5 reps to 185 x23. Yes, part of that is his inabili ty to show strength in the squat but I'll be honest with you - his leg strength was abysmal. We had to stick with this basic phase for about 6 months until we were able to move onto something different. The goal of this part of training is to have each lift, including the suppl emental part, done in 15-18 minutes. So the two main lifts and their supple mental work shoul d take you 30-36 minutes. Until the lifter is able to make this time, we do not move on to another template. The first couple of workouts, I keep a running clock, but I do not push too hard. I jus t want to see where the athlete is at without it being too coached. For the sake of simpli city, we want to see where the lifter is naturally. I don't want to sacrifice coaching and technique to beat a timer. I also make sure a set is never rushed. It's not about beating the clock, it's about being in great training shape so that the clock isn't an issue. This is a very basic workout that ju st about everyone shoul d be able to complete. Rememb er that there is obviously going to be a lag in time between lifts - this doesn't count towards the total time. Do one lift, finish and then take a .break and set up for the next one. Please don't be anal about the time between lifts. Not until I feel the athlete is ready to push hard will I do the same. In other words, we don't test until I know his mind and body are 100%. ASSI STANCE The assistance work is a bit different than what most people are used to: we use dum bbel l, body weight and kettlebell movements for assistance work in a circuit type .fashion. There are four exercises per workout and we generally do 3-5 sets each. However, if someone cannot do all the reps for a given movement, I have him return to it until he completes all the reps. In the beginning, it's important to remember that the total amount of reps on these movements are going to vary greatly from person to person. What is listed below is the end goa l. I would highly advise you to err on the side of too few reps in a movement if you are not used to it. If you don't have a kettlebell (KB), you can easily build a T-Handle using plumping pipe for under $10. There are a dozen places to find the instructions on the internet; you can load these things up pretty heavy (200+poun ds), so they can be used by a variety of strength levels. These homemade T-Hand les fit standard, not Olym pic, plates; so be sure you have some handy or you are able to buy

42 I 5/3/1 FOREVER them. I bel ieve some places sell T-Handles that take Olympic style plates, so that is certainly an option. The strength of the athlete will largely determine the kettlebell weight, but i.n general, high school males all do 53 pounds on the swing and 36 pounds with the snatch. Again, tailor this how ever you see fit. If you do not want to do any swings or KB movements, a bodyweight squat for sets of 10-25 or even a single leg movement can work in its place. Single leg work is great, but if the lifter isn't strong enough to do something on two legs, be wary of trying to do it on one. Make su re he has the strength, coordination and balance to do a one leg movement. Single leg work is done for 5-10 reps; reps are determined by how competent the lifter is at the movement.

The circuit is done five times through and it must be finished in 20 minutes. This is more than enough time to get it done. The only issue is KB snatch as you have to do both arms; this can take a lot of time. You can combine the KB snatch with the KB swing: Do one swing followed by one snatch. This would be two reps. In general, I'll have lifters alternate movements whenever they want - it doesn't really matter too much as they are all basically the same movement. This is incredibly simple work, and just about any male who is of incredibly average strength/conditioning can get through this.

BEG INNER PREP SCHOOL I 43 RUNNING Occas ionally, we will use the Prowler for conditioning, but most of the time we use the Prowler or sled for those that can't squat. For example, I had one athlete who absolutely sucked at squatting. So we would work on his form each day we lifted, but on days he was su pposed to squat, we would use the Prowler and sled to help strengthen his legs. This way he was getting qual ity work for his hips and legs without having to worry about technique. Remem ber that our ultimate goal is to get them stronger, overall. If you have access to a leg press machine, this would be a good time to use it. Running also became one of the goals for the beginner program for my high school athletes. For running, the big focus on this phase was the one-mile run. I insisted they run three times per week for at least one mile, no more than three. The main goal of this was to have the ability to run one mile; that's about it. I am amazed at how few healthy people can run one mile, even at a slow pace. The only time I let this slide was if the athlete was involved in sports or was in-season. For a change of pace, I gave them several running workouts that could be done at the local track. Remember I live in a small town, and the track is open to the publ ic. You may not have that option, so I recommend running on the street or an open field of grass; be creative. Choose ONE of the distances/workouts listed below. DI STANCE 100w, 200w, 'fOOw, 800w, NUMBBR DP RUNS 10-16 6-8 lf-6 2-3 I never worried about rest times between the runs - jus t get it done. The only thing that I stressed was to run, not sprint. Keep the mouth/jaw loose and try to relax as much as you can. Some of the kids would run the stadium steps or the hill. I didn' t really care too much as long as they were running. For the kids that wanted something extra on the days they weren't lifting, I made sure to stress that they can do whatever they want provided it was bodyweight. To make things simple , I instructed them to do the same basic assistance work we do in the weight room. Since few kids had access to kettlebells, they did the single leg variations. They were free to do this everyday they weren't in the weight room, including the days they ran. So if you want to do more, this is the answer. The whole point that was stressed is that we lift in my weight room, nowhere else. No one screws up their training more than people who don't what the hell they are doing. I can't tell you how many times I had to pound this into their heads. And 10 0% of the time when they screw this up, it showed. Everyone that committed to this plan got better. And not jus t a little bit; seeing the change in them was absol utely amazing. I had teachers, neighbors and parents all remark about the physical, emotional and social changes when they began training. And to my su rprise, it wasn't jus t the barbell. These kids loved being challenged by .the running and the bodyweight work.

44 I 5/3/1 FOREVER Having this plan has done wonders for everyone that has used it. Having a good general base of training, one that draws upon a variety of ideas, will set you up for the rest of your training ca reer. And in the case of these kids, it helps them und erstand the importance of balance in training. I stress this over and over again, especially when the kids are about to go to college. I want to teach them how to train, how to be about more than ju st weight on the bar, and how to push themselves. I have five goals for the beginner program: • Each main lift and the supple mental lift to be finished in 15 -18 minutes. The key to this is to not force the time; rather, they shoul d be able to achieve this goal on their own. I don't force the issue in the beginning, but as a lifter gets in better shape, this time rule should be easy and effortless. The total time spent for both lifts should be around 30-36 minutes. • Assistance work done in 20 minutes. • Be able to run one mile. • Learn how to jump and land correctly. • Set the grou ndwork for a balanced training program. Runn ing. Lifting. Jump ing. Cal isthenics. Not a bad way to start training. I have each of the lifters try to milk this program for as long as they can. After each cycle, they will increase their training maxes. Because some of them are terribly weak in the one or more of the lifts, we may only advance them five pounds for the squat and dead lift; or we will repeat a cycle or repeat a cycle using fractional plates added to bar. There is no timetable to how long to perform this template. If a lifter stalls in a lift (and this always happens to the bench press and press), I offer these solutions: • Back up three cycles and repeat. • Back up three cycles and start push ing last set for a PR or a goal set. This doesn't mean you go crazy on the last set and let your form go to hell. I only recommend they do this if there technique is sound. • Back up three cycles and increase the volume of the supp lemental work {7-10x5 @ FSL). • Back up three cycles and perform 5x5/3/1 (see this book for explanation). • Back up three cycles and use SSL (see this book for explanation). The other avenues you might address are diet and sleep. One needs to eat to gain strength. This may not be a huge factor in the first couple of months as the added stimu lus of training is often enough. People will get stronger, in general, as long as they are training hard enough. At some point, you are going to have to eat to su pport your training. Sleep is essential for any physical or mental effort -the only person that would debate this is someone who doesn't have enough sleep.

BORING BUT BIG I 45 The final avenue to take is to move on to another template; start fresh and attack it. Remember to never look at a plateau as a bad thing; it is your way to show you've got fight, discipline and consistency. • Always a Leader template. BO RING BU T BIG • Great for people looking to gain some muscle. • Strength can be gained in younger lifters. • Not a good option for athletes, true beginners and very advanced lifters. • 85% TM for most lifters, 90% for beginners. Of all the 5/3/1 supple mental work, Boring But Big (BBB) is easily the most popu lar. Whether because it feeds the closet bodybuild er, is very easy to implement or jus t plain works, this is a go-to template for many people. Let's clear up a few misconceptions before we get started. First, BBB is not a good template for very new beginners or advanced lifters. Beginners do not do well with multiple sets of ten reps, as they do not have the strength or technique to do them cor rectly. I have coached many beginners and have seen enough "form check" videos to realize that beginners do not do well when fatigued. It' s painful. I'm being nice here, actual ly. There is a very easy test to determine whether or not you are a beginner. If you are asking the question, "I wonder if I'm a beginner?" then you are one. If you want something concrete, I'd say, in general, a beginner has less than one year of consistently training the right way. So you can be a beginner if you've been training for five years and would best describe your training as "sporadic" or "a mish-mash of every program read in a magazine or on the internet:' The latter is a good example of having too much information and not having the common sense to realize that not everything is gospel. Do people really believe everything they read? I am holding out hope that they do not. This helps me retain some hope for the future. Advanced lifters instinctively realize that BBB is not for them, and if they do attempt it, the know that they percentage of their supple mental work is very, very low. The reason for this is simple: 60% for an intermediate is not the same as 60% for an advanced lifter. If you can do 60% or 70% (or what ever percentage) without much mental/physical preparation or attention to technique, you are not advanced. Let's use some number to illustrate this. Let's say a 200-pound guy, who has been training for about two years, has a 300- pound squat. 70% is equal to 210 pounds, which he can d.o in his sleep. For the same sized guy, who has a 550-p ound squat, 70% is 385 pounds. This is not an easy set and requires great focus, from the beginning to the end. Also, the more advanced you are, the further you are from your peak strength.

46 I 5/3/1 FORE VER Also, advanced lifters have learned to use more of themselves in each set. Scientifically, we call this intermusclar (individual muscles working together) and intramuscu lar (individ ual muscle fibers in the muscle) coordi nation. To illu strate this point with my younger lifters, I use this simple analogy: "When I lift a weight, I use 90% of my body and muscles to lift it. You (the beginner), may only use 60%. That is why an advanced lifter is generall y more tired after a set and requires more rest. He is simply doing more work:' Now the percentages I give in the example are not exact - it is an example. The point is that there is a huge difference between the two kinds of lifters. And this is one reason why 888 , at least at the prescribed percentages, is not ideal for an advanced lifter. It would simply run him down and negatively affect the rest of his training. Interesting side point on the topic of inter- and intramu scular coordination; this is one reason why the Bulgar ian Olympic Lifting team only uses a few lifts in their training. First, using few lifts al lows the lifters to become more efficient at doing each lift. Second, by becoming more efficient in each lift, they can train them more often without getting too sore. This point is HUGE when training ath letes, especially in-season (but really in every aspect). Athletes do not need a ton of variety; they need to get better at a few lifts. This allows them to master these lifts and not get too sore. Athletes need much more than to just get stronger in the weight room. So this allows them to train other aspects without the strength training interfering. It's a simp le approach that is rooted in common sense. Keeping in this theme, let me touch up on the ridi culous idea of "always changing the exercises ;· "confusing the mus cl e" or whatever nonsense is being touted as fact in the house of lies. This ide a is fine for your mom, provided she wants to exercise and not train. Mar k Ripp etoe best defined training as, " ... physical activity performed for the pu rpose of satisfying a long-term performance goal, and is therefore about the process instead of the workouts themselves: ' On the other hand, exercising is, " ... physica l activity performed for the effect it produces today - right now. Each workout is performed for the pu rpose of producing a stress that satisfies the im med iate needs of the exerciser: bur ning some calor ies, getting hot, sweaty, and out of breath, pumping up the biceps, stretching -- ju st punching the physical clock. Exercise is physical activity done for its own sake, either dur ing the workout or immed iately after it's through: ' Again , this is Mar k waxing poetic. The di stinction is clear . There is nothing wrong with exercising. My parents do it, and I like my parents. If I thought it was bad, I would' ve set them straight a long time ago. However, if you are reading this now, you are serious about training. You care where you are and where you want to go. And always changing the movements or exercises, at least the main lifts, is sur e fire way to never make progress. People seem to forget that the proper stimu lus for growth/ strength/pr ogress can be simpl y made through sets, reps and weight. And this is one reason why the barbell is such a good deal in life - you work hard, you work smart and you can actua lly see progress. It's a fair deal. I always tel l the younger lifters that come to my gym that they will not see a better return on hard, smart and consistent work than the barb ell. Life is not fair, not even in the weight room; some of us can barely squat a barbell when they start. Others have the gift and can squat 315 without much trou ble. However, we can all get better. No matter where one starts, progress can happen with the proper mental and physical effort. Random training, oth erwise known as exercisi ng, prod uces crap results in the long term. Even if you are training for

BORING BU T BIG I 47 chaos or a bevy of different tests, consistent, simple training will always win. Always. Now let's get to the trainin g. Boring But Big has a lot of different variations in the percentages, so let's stick to the ones that have produced the best results. Just make sure you are eating enough to su pport the work that you are doing. If you are not willing to eat, at least the bare minimum of meat/eggs, you might as well not waste your time. Do another template or another less intensive program. TRAININ G DAYS There are two options to doing BBB: three or four days a week. The amount of work you do, and the recovery from said work, fits better when training like this. You can always change what days you do what lift or even what days you actually train on; everyone has a different schedule and this doesn't matter at all.

The first week you will squat, bench press and deadl ift. The second week you will press, squat and bench press. The third week is deadl ift, press and squat. This schedu le, especially when using BBB, is ideal for many people. With this schedul e, you have four full days of recovery at your disposal. Some of the variations of listed below may be slightly different than what is listed above. But most of the time, we will lift three to four days per week. FOREVER BBB There are two options to Forever BB B. One is for more advanced lifters; this is the one that has lower percentages. The other is for beg inners or intermediates. I must point out that the heavier version of this does not mean you will make more progress. This is about getting some more volume in your training, not trying to impress anyone or feed your ego. You will have to take some personal respon sibil ity and choose the one that is correct, not the one you want to do. The examples below are using 3/5/1 programming. If you feel the original 5/3/1 style of programming fits you better, use it. WBEKDNE 70% x 5 80% x5 WIEK TWD 65% x 5 75°/o x 5 WDK THR E 75°/o x 5 85°/o x 5

I also recommend this option for people that have trouble with recovery or are new to BBB . BBB makes you sore and is not easy, especially if you are not doing the proper recovery work. Uill11t1rca 7-0°/o x 5 80% x5 90"/o x 5 5 sefs of 10 reps @ 50% 65"/o x 5 7-5°/o x 5 85"/o x 5 5 sefs of 10 reps @ 'fO"lo WBIK THUB t5"/o x 5 85"/o x 5 95"/o x 5 5 sefs of 10 reps @ 60"/o Note: I recommend that Forever BBB sup plemental work is only to be done with the SA ME lift as the main work. I do not recommend squatting and then performing the deadl ift su pplemental work. For those low on time or from their own experience with Boring But Big, you can also use Forever BBB Light. This variation has you only performing three work sets for the su pplemental lift. So you will be doing three sets of ten reps instead of five sets of ten reps; ORIGIN AL BO RING BU T BIG Now while Forever BBB is fairly new, the majority of people have been using the original BBB, which uses one constant percentage. This is usua lly around 40-60% of the TM. To be safe, I usually recom mend 50-55%, as this is a good way to get some extra volume without totally ruining the rest of your training and inhibiting your ability to sit on a toilet with a semblance of grace and integrity. By far the biggest mistake people make when using BBB (and really 99% of all training) is that people are more than willing to throw out tomorrow's workout for today's ego. In essence, they are exercising under the guise of training. Now this doesn't mean you don't train hard or you are not going to get sore - it means that if you are too sore to do the next workout properly, you need to address one or more of the fol lowing three things: your recovery, your training or that you are kind of a wimp. The latter has nothing to do with "being a man" or whatever cliche people use. It means that training is not easy. And if you don't have a healthy set of proverbial balls and unstoppable and undying will, you will not get that far.

50 I 5/3/1 FOR EVER WIBK DNB tO°lo x 5 80°/o x 5 90°/o x 5 5 sefs of 10 reps @ '10-60°/o WIBK TWD 65°/o x 5 t5"1o x 5 85"/o x 5 5 sefs of 10 reps@ '10- 60"/o t5"1o x 5 85% x5 95"/o x 5 5 sefs of 10 reps@ '10- 60°/o Note: You can do the main work with one lift and the suppl emental work with the opposite lift. For example, you can do the main work for the bench press and the supple mental work with the press. The key is to keep the percentage that you use for the BBB work constant, at least for each individual lift. You would be surprised at how many lifters use a lower percentage for the squat and dead lift (espe cially the deadl ift) and still have a great amount of success. So don't be afraid to test out which lifts respond better to different percentages when using BBB . For a guideline, and you probably are going to guess where I'm going with this, start lighter than you think. You do that, you won't ruin your training. Start way too heavy and you'll dig your own grave and have a hard time getting out. One thing that I hope people learn, and something I've said for a long time now, is you don't have to get it perfect right away. So when you are learning training, and really learning anything, it's best to find your way using something that won't ruin you physically or mentally. Think about it like this: when you learn how to play the guitar, you don't tackle Van Halen's Eruption or a Rush song. You learn a few scales and give the AC/DC song Back in Black a noble effort. That is one reason, out of many, why "start too light" is such an important principle in the 5/3/1 program. You give yourself a little leeway in training. FULL BOD Y BO RING BUT BIG We've been doing this sporadicall y for less than a year, so the jur y is still out on Full Body Boring But Big (for fun we shall call it FBBBB ). The key to doing this is simple: don't be an asshole. I can see this totally getting out of hand for anyone that has a huge ego, no training experience, no quali ty prep work, or who doesn't have anyone training with them that can help them. But if you can dial in the correct percentages for each lift, it can work very well and give you some variety in your training and training day. In general, I always start with 50% for the supplemen tal work. As long as the bar speed is good on the main lifts, we stick with this percentage. If one lift seems to be suffering, we make adjus tments with the percentages, recovery work, the training days, or even how many days/ week we train. However, if you are lazy with your recovery this is not for you. Be honest with your level of commitment. Below is the example of what I've found to work best for someone looking to train four days/week.

The suppl emental work for the deadlift is generally the most taxing on the lifter, so I wanted to end the week with that workout. This gives you two full days of recovery work. We dnesday has to be a pro-active day of recovery too. As you can see, this is not for everyone. The three-day/week option is a little more palatable as it allows more rest between training days. The lifts/schedule you follow on Monday of the first training week is not repeated until We dnesday of the second week. Essentially you are following an A/B/C, D/ A/B, CID! A style of programming.

This does a great job of limiting the strain on the lower back during this phase, still getting in quality work with the added benefit of having a stronger grip. The dead lift is a very stressful lift, especially for an intermediate or advanced lifter. So there is no shame in doing the right thing for your training. Your meat does not grow when you martyr yourself in the weight room.

52 I 5/3/1 FOREVER BO RING BUT BIG CHALLENGE If you have been using the BBB template for three cycles, this may be a good time to attempt the BBB Challenge. It's also imperative that you use the correct training max - this is not the time to over estimate your training max in a desperate hope to "add mass:' If you are new to BBB, do NO T do the challenge. Those that have done the BBB Challenge know that it is not easy. But there are a number of mistakes that I see people making when attempting the challenge: 1 Expecting it to NO T be a challenge. I know the word "challenge " is in the name, but there are a lot of people expecting this to be easy. It's not, thus the name. Lots of people have comple ted the challenge and a lot of people have failed. It's the nature of challenging yourself; sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. i! Not eating right. Eating right for the BBB Chall enge is simple: you eat, a lot. I listed an example diet in the original posting of the challenge , but I'm not sure how many people followed it. The point is I've been doing this long enough to know very few people actually eat like they care about their training. So if you want to give yourself the best shot at the challe nge, espec ially those that realize how hard this might be for them, you have to give yourself the best shot at suc cess. And jus t because "FingerBa ngin78" on some random forum did n't eat right, doesn't mean YOU don't have to. Despite modern blow-hard rhetoric, we aren't equal. 3 Not using the proper training max. 90% TM is the maximum, 85% is best for those with several years of consistent, proper training. The point is you have to do the program as written. 4 Not following the program as written. This drives me nuts because of the time and effort I put into it. But at the end of the day, the lifter mu st take responsibility for his actions and his unwill ingness to follow what has been proven to work. Every program I write has been tested arid rewritten and tested and rewritten. I take a great amount of pride in what I do and the programs that I write. There is a reason for everything. S Not being prepared. This is not something to do to "j ump start" your training or after a layoff. If your body is not in-shape and ready for this volu me, you will suffer. With all that being said, the challenge is fun as hell. And something that can give some more mean ing to your training - nothing makes five sets of ten reps of squatting or dead lifting more tolerable than an end goal. For your work sets, we will use the 5's Progression for each lift. We do not go for a PR on the final set. You can use the classic 5/3/1 or the 3/5/1 setup; in regards to this challenge, it really doesn't matter that much. So do what you are comfortable with. Below is the 3/5/1 example. Just switch the first two weeks if you want to do the classic 5/3/1 programming.

I'm hesitant to recommend this, as I know people have a huge problem putting their ego aside and using the correct training max for the correct program. At the very most, we start with 85% training max. If we use this BBB variation, we are usually looking very long term and making sure the training max fits within the program. So many times, I won't base it on a% of the training max, rather

54 I 5/3/1 FOREVER on what numbers I know will work for the supplemen tal work. From there, we can plan very long in advance and still come out farther along then most. When I use the phrase "long term" we generall y are thinking about 10-12 cycles in advance. So if you use this variation, I'd advise you to look farther down the line than ju st a few cycles. In other words, this is a small part of a bigger plan, and it's fine if you ju st want to play it by ear. But if you do that, disregard this template. This variation will use the first work set as your supp lemental work.

I will try to make this as clear as possible. The first option is for people who just don't have the time to do the "normal" BB B. Or they have found out, from their own experience, that the "5x10" protocol does not work for them. Now if you are new to BBB , do one of the prior listed BBB variations. It's been proven to work.

This variation is a no-brainer for older lifters who still want to occa sionally do some higher rep sets (in relation to the norms of athlete or powerlifting training) and not drain them of their entire life force or chi or, as Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper calls it, "essence" or "precious bod ily fluids:' The other option is to do the supple mental work for the squat on both the squat and deadl ift days. You could also do the same for the bench press OR the press. Since I know I'll get the question about the dead lift, the answer is no. Ju st not a good thing for recovery pu rposes.

You could also start with 70% and work your way down to 50%. This allows you to get the heavier work in when you are still fresh. JUMPS /THROWS. BO RING BU T BIG - During this phase of training, we cut back the total amount of jump s and throws in training. This is du e to the high amount of supplemen tal volu me. In general, we do about ten total ju mps or throws per workout during this phase. We also make sure to pick exercises that, for the athlete/lifter, are pretty low stress. So this is not a good time to introduce bounding. We generall y keep it simple with box jump s and some medicine ball throws.

ASSIST ANCE WORK. BO RING BUT BIG • Push - 25-50 total reps. • Pull - 25-50 total reps. • Single Leg/Core -0-50 total reps. BORING BUT BIG I 57 You are free to su perset the pullin g work with the pressing movements (bench press and the press). This is a great way to shorten the workout as this has no negative affect on your pressing strength. And if it does, you are very out-of-shape and very weak. So even more of a reason to do it. There is really no excuse that will save you. The one thing that must be accounted for is the single leg/core work in this template. I do not recom mend any lower back work (back raises, for example) and very little single leg work done. The only thing I recommend from this category during BBB is abdominal work. I highly recommend you use less stressful assistance work durin g BBB . For example, you woul d use pushdowns and extensions instead of weighted dip s. BBB is incredibly stressful and this is not the time to be burning the candle at both ends. CONDITIONING, BORING BUT BIG One of the bigge st mistakes people make when running Boring But Big is not taking into account their condition ing. They either do nothing or attempt to run themselves into the ground. If you want to do harder condi tioning work such as running hill s, push ing the Prowler or something similar, I recommend you only do this two times per week. And these two times will only be on training days. Preferably on the same day you perform the squat or deadlift OR on a training day that is foll owed by a day of rest. I do recommend you perform some easy conditioning-as many days as you wish provided you do so in a manner that al lows recovery. Boring But Big will make you sore and take a lot out of you - so make sure you aren't adding more stuff into your training that inhibits your recovery. To make it simple , if it takes away from your training, you are not doing yourself any favors. • 2 days of hard conditioning, maximum. • 3-5 days of easy conditioning. Rememb er that the goal of BBB is not to get in great condition, at least in terms of running or the Prowler. The goal is strength and size - so don't use this template if your goal is conditioning based. BBB is always a Leader template. After finishing either two or three cycles of BBB, you will change to an Anchor template. There are a number of different templates to choose from and all of them have been tested by me or by people I have directly worked with. In other words, these have been proven to work and have been refined and tweaked so you don't have to.

58 I 5/3/1 FORE VER • 5's Progression, Jokers and First Set Last. • PR Set and First Set Last. • PR Set, Jokers and First Set Last. • 5/3/1 and Widowmakers. • 5's Progression and First Set Last. • Full Body, 5's PRO. • Full Body, PR Set. • Beyond, FSL. • Original 5/3/1. FIRST SET LA ST • Can be used as an Anchor or a Leader template. • Great for increasing volume without crushing you. • Can be used by lifters at all levels. • TM between 85-90%. First Set Last (FSL) is one of the first ways I began adding extra volume to the main lifts, and it con tinues to be the most versatile for one reason - it's easy to program AND the numbers, if using an appropriate training max, stay in line with your progress and your programming. As you've seen in a variation of BBB and, later, in Boring But Strong, using your first set last can be used in a variety of ways. However, for the pu rposes of cla rity, First Set Last generall y refers to one of two things.

Bar speed is hard for many to figure out - people woul d rather take everything to failur e and bel ieve this is the only way to train. While there is a case to be made to taking lifts to failur e, this is not a long-term solution to training. Most lifters cannot do this all the time. Yes, there are always the outliers, but for most, this is not sustainab le. And really, if you have the bug to take things to failur e, it's best to use assistance work to do so. This will have less of an overall impact on your training than routinely squatting and pullin g until you pass out. Of all the supple mental templates, 5x5 FSL is the one that is the most sustainable over the longest period of time. It's not perfect and, honestly, doing this week after week would be pretty damn boring to most. The second way to do this is to perform a Widowmaker set with the first working set; this term I got from Dante Trudel' s DoggCrapp program. A Widowmaker set is usuall y done for 15 -20 reps {20 reps being the goal). 65°/. x 5 7-5°/. x 5 85°/. x 5 1x20 @ 65°/. tO"lo x 6 80°/. x 6 90"/o x 6 1x20 @ tO"lo 7-5°/. x 5 85°/. x 6 95°/o x 1 1x20 @ t5°/. The Widowmaker sets, especially for the squat and dead lift suck. If you've ever done sets of 20 on these movements, you know exactly what I'm talking about. I once read, and I don't know who to credit this to, that if everyone did 20 rep squats, the whole world would be stronger; mentally and physically. The unique thing about 5x5 FSL is that in can be used as a Leader and Anchor template. And it kind of files in the face of my general rule s for programming a Leader template; used as the first template in training, it is generall y the least intense/strenuous. But it is also a very efficient way to train for many people. As a Leader template, it works for people with limited time and who don't recovery well. It's also great for more advanced lifters who need to back off harder/mor e intense program ming than most lifters. This will allow for progress without draining the reserves. For many lifters, they may only need six weeks to ramp up their lifting, and the rest of the time is devoted to getting quali ty work without beating themselves up. I know, it doesn't scream HARDCORE 4 LIFE, but the reality of training is that the old er/more experienced you get, the more you need to stay on the slow road. Despite the rumors, the stronger you get, the less time you hold that peak level of strength. 5x5 FSL is also an ideal way for athletes to train as it's easy to recovery from, the volume is easy to reg ulate, speed/po wer is maintained and now you can actually do all the other things an athlete must do: run, jump , agilities, skill work and in most cases, school work. Athletes and their coaches have known for a long time that everything has to be in balance. While strength is very important to all athletes, if the time/effort it takes to lift takes time away or diminishes the other areas of training, it becomes a liabil ity. Most of these templates can be done lifting three or four days/week, unless specified.

62 I 5/3/1 FOREVER ASSIST ANCE. 5'S PRO . 5X5 FSL The base level of assistance is: • Push - 50-100 total reps per workout. • Pull -50-100 total reps per workout. • Singl e Leg/Core - 50-100 total reps per workout. You can also use this template to increase your overall total reps, in each of the assistance catego ries. However, if you do this you should not push your conditioning at the same time. In general, if you use the following assistance plan, cut out the hard conditioning and use nothing but general aerobic work. • Push - 100+ total reps per workout. • Pull -100+ total reps per workout. • Single Leg/Core - 100+ total reps per workout. If you choose to use this template while pushing your conditioning, you will need to decrease your assistance work. To make it simple - if you do more hard conditioning, you should be doing less assistance work. • Push - 25-50 total reps per workout. • Pull - 25-50 total reps per workout. • Single Leg/Cor e - 25-50 total reps per workout. I also recommend that you carefully choose your assistance movements dur ing this time -pic k assistance work that doesn't, in any way, interfere with your recovery. COND ITIONING. 5'S PRO. SXS FSL The conditioning can vary greatly on this template and is pretty open ended. If you are using this as a normal base program, I recommend 2-3 days of hard conditioning and as many days of easy con ditioning as you want/need. In general, once you start push ing your hard conditioning to four days/ week, this is when the assistance should reflect that change (i.e. do less assistance). We generall y use bar speed on the work sets and FSL work to determine how we are doing - if this becomes a continual problem (usuall y more than 2 weeks) we change something. This change could be any of the following: changing training days/week, using the deload and planning to use it before it's needed, improving recovery (sleep, diet, etc.), using more efficient conditioning or reducing volum e on all lifting (this could be assistance or supplemen tal work). Many times we will reduce the supple mental work to 3x5 FSL from the beginning to account for the stress of the conditioning work.

FI RST SET LAST I 63 Here is an example of using this template as a Leader. Using 5's PR O/FSL as a Leader template breaks the general rules of how we program, but it works extremely well. Essentially you are giving your body a break from lifting, focusing on bar speed and making sure everything is perfect for your Anchor template. Also this is a good way to program for those that tend to shit the bed, get hurt or jus t suck at lifting after six weeks (or even shorter).

S'S PRO GRESSION , JOKERS AND FIRST SET LAST Joker sets are my biggest regret -I didn't do a great job of explaining how they fit within the entire program. Even while writing this book, I had to leave out a lot of stuff that I do, or have other people

64 I 5/ 3/1 FORE VER do, because I learned my lesson with Joker sets. Orig inally publ ished on the private forum, and eventually in the Beyond book, Joker sets became so overused and overdone that it had the exact opposite effect from what we want. Namely, making people better. However, through this book I'm hoping to clear everything up and give people the CORR ECT way to program them. This was my mistake and this is my way of atoning for the ignorance. For the uninitiated, Joker sets are extra works sets added above the highest percentage set for the day. These are usually done for 1-2 sets of 1-3 reps at a 5-10% increase above the highest set of the day. It is not terribly difficul t to program or understand. You ju st go a little bit heavier. Now let's clear the air about Jokers: they are fun to do but never necessary. The only people who "need to feel the weight" are either weak mentall y or didn't do the correct assistance and athletic work; The correct work produces a strong midsection, strong back and a mind capable of not folding like a newspaper under minimal stress. Whene ver I hear someone say that the weight felt heavy at a powerlifting meet, I'm amazed at the stupid ity. You are at a godda mn powerlifting meet - the weight is supp osed to be heavy. You are doing a one-rep max! If you don't want it to feel heavy, get stronger or lower your attempts. I recommend using only 31511 programming when doing Joker sets and First Set Last. With this setup you only use Joker sets on the first and third weeks of the cycle. The below example shows how I program it. This way we have two harder weeks with an easier week between them. This is especially important when training four days a week. Week two is all about speed and perfection; we emphasize the qual ity of every rep and make su re the athlete is dialed in and fast.

If you do, you should not be doing Joker sets. It's another hard reality that people need to remember. You should not be missing weights in training. Some programs thrive on the lifter missing weights - this is not one of them. If you like failur e, I would recommend you try another program. I recommend doing only 1-2 Joker sets per workout. Remember they are to be done in 5-10% increments over your final work set of the day. In general, I would recommend you stick to sets of 1-3 repetitions for each Joker set.

FI RS T SET LAST j 65 PR SET AND FIRST SET LAST The PR set is one of the main components of the original 5/3/1 program. Honestly, I think it's the most fun part of the program because it is the most challenging. And I don't know many people who lift weights that don't love to be challenged. There is something incredibly satisfying about setting and reaching a goal. When usi ng PR sets and Fi rst Set Last, I recommend using 3/5/1 programming. Again , you only do PR sets on the first and third weeks of the cycle.

It is simply setting a personal record or reaching a specific goal for the day. The PR could be a rep record based on that particular weight or a record based on the rep-max formula. Setting a goal for the PR set is best done based on what you cu rrently feel like or, if you have a coach, something that he challe nges you for. Most coaches can watch your bar speed and attitude during your warm-up and workout and know the best way to challenge you. Do NO T do the lift with the mindset of "we will see what happens: ' Have a plan. Execute that plan.

66 I 5/3/1 FO RE VER In general, once I reach my goal or my athlete reaches his goal, the set is over. When coaching athletes, I want them to have a specific goal for every set they do-whether it is about technique, a mental approach or even an odd cue that I think will help them. I belie ve that if you are in the weight room and are doing work, quali ty ALWAYS trumps quantity. Qua ntity work is akin to busy work - it's pointless in the long run. If you want shit to get done, focus on doing it right. PR SET , JOK ERS· AND FIRST SET LAST This is the one we like to use in my weight room. I have gotten some feedback about the difficulty with doing Joker sets after a PR set. This has never made any sense to me, as we have never had this issue with athletes or lifters in my weight room. I can assure you it's not because of a loud and brazen coaching style. There is nothing worse than cheerleaders in a weight room. People barking cliches is about as annoying as a thousand paper cuts. If you've got to become a cheerleader when you are coaching, you are not a good coach. If you've got to become a cheerleader when you are a spotter or lifting partner, you are doing no one any good. Cues and talking the lifter through the set is what makes a good coach. If you are familiar with the UFC and MMA, or are even a casual fan, you know the great coach Greg Jackson. In my estimation (and I'm not alone with this) he is the best corner man in the game. Watch him between rounds and watch his approach. He first calms the fighter down and speaks in a direct and calm voice. He then gives the fighter one thing to work on during the next round. One thing. One cue. Watch other corners between rounds; the fighter is getting five different suggestions from three dif ferent guys. And the amount of smoke they blow up his ass is ridicu lous. If a fighter is losing or lost a round, he needs to know. The point is that a coach is not there to scream and be Tony Robbins. He is there to coach. And when a lifter is already at an emotional peak before or during a set, the single worst thing a coach can do is push him over the edge. A coach must be the anchor, the center, and he cannot do this if he himself is a storm. Like the previous templates, I recommend using a 3/5/1 style of programming with this approach. You can also use S's PRO with this template.

I wrote a template one time calle d "Harden the Fuck Up :' It had everything in it: specific conditioning, recovery, mobil ity, even "lifestyle" things. The lifting was 5/3/1 and Widowmakers. This lifting template is incredibly simple, and if you can't get excited about PR sets and widowmaker sets, you might as well bow out of lifting. Let me give credit where credit is du e. The term "widowmaker" comes from Dante Trudel, he of DoggCrapp fame. While I claim little influence, at least directly, from the bodybuilding world, Trudel was a breath of fresh air in all areas of training and programming. He belie ves in hard work and pushing the body (get stronger in basic movements to drive size), but there was some thought given to how he programs. In this day and age, that is very rare. Those of you that are familiar with the different templates and 5/3/1 challenges will recognize some similarities to this template and the Rest Pause Chal lenge. But there are some differences, and I think you will see this as new and improved, at least in my eyes it is. The one thing I must point out is that Widowmaker sets are not for everyone - if you form isn't great and you don't have good core strength, I don't recommend doing this. First, let's discuss the sets and reps for this template. WBIK DNB 65% x 5 t5% x 5 WIBK TWD t0°!o x 3 80% x 3 WBIK THRll t5% x 5 85% x .3

While the pressing movements tend to tire out quicker due to smaller muscles/strength in the up per body, the squats can be really pushed dur ing this phase. The deadl ift is another story though. From a safety standpoint, I can't recommend pushing this lift like the squat. This doesn't mean you don't push this set, just be cognizant when your form breaks down and stop the set. You can also use the 5's Progression on your work sets dur ing this phase. If you feel you need a little more work prior to your PR set to get your body ready, this would be a good option. There are a couple different variations of this template. The first is a little tougher and while it may look good on paper, not everyone can handle it physically. And while I love this template, it is not something you can do every week of the year. Hell , even Dante recommend you take a couple weeks off of his DoggCrapp training and cruise.

One thing I rec ommend to many people is to use a more intensive variation for a pressing movement and either the squat or deadl ift. For example, you can do "PR Set, Jokers and First Set Last" with the squat and the press. For the bench press and dead lift, I would choose "5's Progression and First Set Last:' The good thing about this is you are really pushing two lifts and allowing a little better recovery by not killing yourself on the dead lift and the bench press. I would recommend this for any lifter who has a few miles of lifting scars on his body. In general, I would recommend the "5's Progression/First Set Last" for the two lifts that aren't being pushed. This still al lows you to make progress on these lifts. ASSIST AN CE. FIRST SET LAST You can choose to do less assistance work if your recovery or your time becomes an issue. • Push - 50-100 total reps per workout. • Pull - 50-100 total reps per workout. • Single Leg/Cor e - 50-100 total reps per workout. COND ITIONING . FIRST SET LAST • 2-3 days of hard conditioning. • 3-5 days of easy conditioning. In general, the First Set Last templates are best used as Anchors to BBB or S's Pro, 5x5 FSL. There are a lot of possibil ities for how to program this, but here are the most common templates that people use.

74 I 5/3/1 FO RE VER Remem ber that between each Leader and Anchor template, you must perform the ?1-h Week Deload. After the Anchor template, you must test your training maxes. Don't be a fool with your training max; increasing your training max too much is a sign that you want to get worse. Being patient and build ing your physical awesomeness, brick by brick, is the way of champions. FULL BOD Y (1 000 °/a AWESOME ) • Great for intermediate lifters. • Ideal for those who want to push conditioning in all phases of training. • Full-b ody training might not be best option for advanced lifters. • 85% TM. This template was a huge hit on my private forum; full-body training has made a resurgence. But like anything, it's not the "be-all and end-all " of training. Because this is three-day/week template and the volume is not as high as BBB , you can push the conditioning a bit more 'during this phase. Once again, you will be using this template for two to three 5/3/1 cycles. After this time, we will move to another template for another two to three cycles. There is a lot of supplemen tal work in Full Body, 1000% Awesome so this is ideal for those that can handle a lot of sub-maximal volume but don't have the time to lift four days/week. I've changed a few things from the original template and think this version is much better. This is strictly a three-day/week program.

100 0% AW ESO ME , ANCH OR I 75 The supple mental work for the second lift of the day (well, except for Friday but you get the point) is based around 80-85% of your TM. This is going to be up to you and you must base it on bar speed. If your bar speed slows down too much at 85%, you must lower the percentage to 80%. Each lift might be a little bit different. But remember that there is no glory in grinding reps at this point. Another option of this template is to increase your total sets of the 80-85% work. For example, instead of 5 sets, you can increase it to 7-8. However, if your bar speed slows down and your other lifts begin to suffer, keep the total sets at 5. There is no glory in doing work to do work. It's pointless and no one celebrates the loser.

The supplemen tal work will be dropped down to First Set Last and be done for five sets of five reps. As in the first part of this training, you can swap out the bench press and the press. Remember that you must be always pushing for great bar speed on every set, especiall y the suppleme ntal work (First Set Last).

This has been explained dozens of times, and I really don't feel like typing out another example. However, one little twist you can do is change the emphasis from week to week.

Of course, you can train four days/week but you'd better be really young or aren't cu rrently falling for diet scams. You will follow the same templates - jus t a variation of the main lifts.

Of course you can sub the power snatch, hang snatch or hang clean for the power clean. But the rest is non-negotiable. This has been tested and tweaked and perfected - so do yourself a favor and give it a shot. This was originally written for a friend of mine who said he wanted to do a few things and do them over and over again. After writing the initial program, we have made the necessary adjustmen ts, and I really like the look of this program. However, it's very clear that this is not for everyone; this is a lot of work on a few lifts. And no, I don't recommend su bstituting the deadl ift for any movement. You can always tell a beginner - he always tells you how much he loves the deadl ift. Talks about it incessantly. Often uses popular cliches such as "the deadl ift is the only real test of strength;' and "grip it and rip it:' The reason is simple. The lift that every beginner can lift the most in, in the shortest amount of time, is the dead lift. So it becomes the favorite lift. After a decade of consistent training, that same lifter is going to say he lo ves every lift. And hates every lift. This is because all of them have given him great joy and huge headaches. He has no favorites because he knows they will all betray him again. I would make sure your TM is at 85% or less. Remem ber that you will be doing this template for two to three cycles.

If you cannot, your training max is way off. The volume work consists of BBS protocol (10x5 @ FSL) or SSL (Second Set Last). This gives you a choice for each lift. I would highly recommend that if you choose BBS for the squat, you do SSL for the dead lift, and vice versa. The bench press and the press are up to you. You can replace any of the bench press days with the press. You can do either the strength or the volum e work for the press. On Monday, feel free to superset the rows and the bench press (or press) - this works itself out nicely ar:id will cut back on_ training time. I really want to stress that your strength work should not be taken lightly. I recommend working up to your training max in ten percent increments for sets of one to five reps.

88 I 5/3/1 FOREVER • The Leader and Anchor template is ONL Y done for 2 Leaders/1 Anchor. NO MORE. • 80% TM. I have used this a few times with people at various times during their cycles. If done with too high of a TM, bar speed suffers. It becomes an absol ute grind. And, without fail, the lifts take a nosedive. Done correctly though it can work. Ju st be sure to follow the rules; they are no longer recommendations. This template can be done three or four days/week. Your training days and movements must meet your real-life recovery. It has been my experience in the last 27 years that people always suffer from Champagne expectations and Beer recovery. Meaning everyone loves to write down what they are going to do, and invariably, it involves 842 movements, done seven days a week. Because if you don't do that, you aren't hardcore. And if you aren't using Navy SEAL Hell Week volu me/sleep patterns and moronic tough-guy quotes on social media, you don't know the meaning of training. I can barely keep up with what it takes to be hardcore anymore. Gr anted, I know most of this shit is for show, but I really think OTH ER people think their entire day should be spent screaming "Carpe Diem!" This is a really long way of saying, "Don't train four days a week if training three days a week is better for your situation'.' The fitness industry can be very tiring. The one big change that you can do, and I recommend most do especially if they are pretty young in terms of training age, is to increase the training max in smaller increments. For the squat and the deadl ift, this would mean increasing the training max only 5 pounds after each cycle. For the bench press and the press, you can do one of two things: increase the training max 2.5 pounds or repeat the same training max and add fractional plates to each set. This accompl ishes the same thing. 65°/o Jt 5 75°/o Jt 5 85% x 5 sefs of 5 reps rO°lo x 5 80% Jt 5 '10°/o x 5 sefs of 5 reps 75°/o Jt 5 85°/o Jt 5 '16°/o x 5 sefs of 5 reps You shouldn 't really struggle on any set, and your bar speed shou ldn't slow down that much on any set, at least not significantly. The training max must be set at 80% for each lift - no higher. Some lifts will even use less than that if you are a more experienced lifter. In general, I try to get the 5x5 lift done in 20 minutes. The cool thing about using the 5x5/3/1 program is the wave like pattern you have from cycle to cycle. Let's say that a lifter uses a training max of 300 pound s to start his 5x5/3/1 cycle. Over three cycles, the lifter's training would look like this:

Week 1 - 5x5 @ 255 Week 2 - 5x5 @ 270 Week 3 - 5x5 @ 285 Now we will add 5 pounds to the training max and continue. Week 1 - 5x5 @ 260 Week 2 - 5x5 @ 275 Week 3 - 5x5 @ 290 Once again, we add 5 pounds to the training max. Week 1 - 5x5 @ 265 Week 2 - 5x5 @ 280 Week 3 - 5x5 @ 295 5X5/3/1 I 89 There are a coupl e ways to set this up, one being a little more bal lsy than the next. If you aren't smart about how you do this, it will come back and bite you in the ass. The first option is doing one main lift per day. This means you are doing the squat, dead lift, bench press or press and using the 5x5/3/1 programming. This can be done three or four days/week, one lift per day.

So if you are finding yourself barely making the reps on this anchor template, you should find another template to perform. The 5x5/3/1 program will run you down if your training max is wrong.

The assistance and conditioning remain the same, too. The Anchor template can be any of the ones listed with 5x5/3/1. You can also perform only one set of five prior to the PR set-incr ed ibly simple and easy to do. With that being said, remember that the correct training max is essential.

I like this template for the simple reason that you are tied down to one thing. It combines the most boring 5/3/1 workout of all (5x5/3/1 ) and combines it with PR sets, which always kick ass. The name comes from doing multiples sets of five reps for one workout and aiming for at least ten reps on your PR set. It's good to have goals. The one drawback to this template is having to pull your TM back to 80%; I see this being a problem for many that struggle with using the appropriate weights for the appropriate program. Remember that bar speed is king with 5x5/3/1. If you grind, you are wrong. The Five and Dime is done as a three-day/week program, using an A workout and a B workout.

10 2 I 5/3/1 FORE VER As you can see, this template takes four weeks to complete one cycle. I usua lly recommend this template for only two cycles and only as a Leader template. Remem ber that you won't always hit ten reps on your PR set, but that should be your goal. If you routinely hit only six or seven reps, your TM is too high. This is completely off-topic, but it's been driving me crazy for some time. Anyone who is familiar with my writings over the past 15 years knows that the fitness industry is much like nature: it seeks bala nce. If the pendulum of thinking swings all the way to the right, it must then swing all the way to the left. At this point of my writing, the biggest shift in training is the issue of form on the big lifts. Around 10 years prior to my writing this text, Mark Ripp etoe wrote one the best books on training, Starting Strength. This gave lifters, especially beginners who had little coaching, a reference on how to perform the squat, dead lift, press and bench press. It was great, and it still is great. At the time, it was desperately needed as there was no definitive text on how to do the lifts and WHY it was import ant to them correctly. Now the most overrated part of training is technique. It is important, but your form is never going to be perfect. Your form may not look like your li fting heroes. Once you get your feet wet, you'll realize you will have your own form, your own style. So now the world is full of people who are worried that they will get cancer if their squat isn't 100% perfect. They'll constantly tell you why they can't load the bar with anything remotely challenging, instead protesting that they need "to work on their form:' There is now buttwink, which is a term no man should want to use. Something, I might add, hadn't existed in the first 100 years of training. And out of nowhere, it popped up like a super-virus infecting anyone with a computer, and the solution being given by anyone with a keyboard. Make sure your form is good but don't use it as a crutch. Nothing is going to be pe rfect in training, including your form. But a good background in basic bodyweight work, a variety of sports, jump ing and cal isthenics would do most of these people well. And perhaps a power outage to their comput ers for a decade.

The template is a bit different than the standard 5/3/1 template, and it takes longer to go through a full cycle. To avoid any confusion, this is a full cycle of God is a Beast.

I would squat and bench on one day. The next day, I woul d clean and incline press. I did this on Monday and Tuesday, respec tively. I would repeat the sequence on Thursday and Friday. Of course, I was a bit reluctant to do this, because one needs a day of rest between movements, right? There is a certain amount of truth in that, espec ially for one trying to build muscle. Break it down, then build it up. You can't do the latter if you keep doing the former. I went with it and did ok, I was skinny and weak so nothing worked and everything worked. It's the curse of having the xylophone rib bones. The point is that if this kind of training gets you going, have at it.

But training instinct isn't something that you are born with; it is developed with experience. I love how people seem to overlook this important fact. And experience is a hard, tough road. While learning from others can help you avoid some pitfalls, the best way to learn about training, about your training, is going out and doing it. Screw up. Lose. Get some dirt on your body. And then pick yourself up and win. This is a trait that can be trained, by the way. The big change to Spinal Tap is going for PRs and/or Joker sets on or after the 90%, 95% and 85% sets. Personally, I use bar speed as an indicator of when or if to go up. Remem ber you don't have to do this every day. You can stick to the basic Spinal Tap sets and reps if you want. As you can see, this is for experienced lifters only. You can switch things up and do the 5's Pro/5x5 FSL for one, two or three lifts. Understand that not every lift can be pushed at the same time, especially with a more experienced lifter.

This isn't terribly exciting, but if you do this for two to three cycles, you'll be better off and in pretty good "train ing shape" provided you follow the gui deli nes. First, this is a three or four-day/week template. Three days per week would have you repeating workouts every nine days. If you have the abili ty to do so, you can also train every other day. Wh ich ever you choose, you will do one main lift per day and will do this for two or three cycles. You do not increase the training max after each lift is done; you will do each lift three times before you increase the training max.

120 I 5/3/1 FOREVER ASSI STANC:E. SPIN AL TAP. S'S PRC The assistance work done on this program must be supe rsetted with the main lift. This will be done exactly like the 5/3/1 Prep Program. So while you'll be doing one main lift per day, each workout will be full body. Since you are doing nine work sets and approximately three warm-up sets, you will have a total of twelve sets to pair with another movement. Here is what I recommend you do for the bench press and press: • Sets 1-3 - Face pull s or band pul l-a parts x 25 reps. • Sets 4-6 - One leg squat x 15 reps/ leg. • Sets 7-9 - Rows x 10-15 reps. • Sets 10-12 -KB Swings or KB snatches. Now you can mix and match different movements, but we always do as much bodyweight work between sets as possibl e. The single leg movements are usua lly always bodyweight with an empha sis on pausing at the bottom and maintaining great position. Do not shortchange your single leg movements with short strides and questionable range of motion. For the squat and deadl ift, I rec ommend the following assistance paired with the main work: • Sets 1-3 - Ab wheel x 25 reps. • Sets 4-6 - Dips or Push-ups x 10-20 reps. • Sets 7-12 - Chin-ups or pu ll-up s x1 0+ reps/Dip s or Push-ups x 10-20 reps (Alternate each between the six sets. For example, you would do three sets of chin-up s and three sets of dips.) The reps per movement may have to change for your current strength level but try to keep them about the same. You can su bstitute inverted rows for chin-ups/pull-up s and hanging leg raises or sit-ups for the ab wheel. You can also perform the assistance work similar to the Krypteia program. C:CNDITIDNING.

I used this variation with some younger lifters I've worked with. These kids had some experience lifting AND about a year with me. And to top that off, I worked with them on this, so there was no confusion. So I have to take that into account when I write this - it helps when the guy who wrote the program is administering it. But it was awesome to see them work like machines, and when you combine this with some bodyweight work and conditioning on the other days, you got yourself a pretty complete program without spending too much time in the gym. This is a good program for people who aren't advanced, who are short on time and who have a pretty good work capacity. You are lifting two days a week and doing your assistance (bodyweight work) on two other days.

And it was pretty easy to handle for the younger kids. I never timed the workouts or the rest periods but it only took a couple workouts to get in the groove and it never became an issue. But then again, these kids had been training a bit and no one gets to train here and be out of shape. ASSI STANCE, SPINAL TAP H.S. Because we had limited time in the weight room, I had them do assistance work at home. Each kid had different recommendations based on their strengths, but here is what I gave one of them: • Bodyweight Squat - 100 total reps. • Push-ups - 50 total reps. • Chin-ups - 25 total reps. • Sit-ups or Leg Raises -100 total reps.

Although it is a possibil ity, we never go for extra reps or Jokers at 85%. But it could still be a possibil ity. Notice the increase for jum ps/throws to twenty per training day (they can also be done on assistance days).

A couple years after Boring But Big made a big splash, I introduc ed his stronger cousin Boring But Strong (BB S). BBB uses five sets of ten reps, while BBS uses ten sets of five reps. It's not terribly com plic ated, but like BBB , Boring But Strong works. It is a blitzkrieg of volume at appropriate weights that allows you to use proper form and bar speed. If your bar speed slows down dur ing your ten sets you either have the wrong training max or you need to take more rest between sets. It never really caught on like BBB , but BBB was first on the scene and it promises size and strength. So I can see its appeal. The funny thing about people today and getting bigger/stronger, no one wants to eat. I don't understand why people want to train hard but totally stall their progress because they have an aversion to a fork. ("Fork Aversion" would be a good name for a grind band.) To paraphrase Ronnie Coleman, "Everyone wants to get bigger and stronger but nobody want to eat the calories:· Boring But Strong works - I think it works better for strength than BBB , and it works especially well, at least for many, for the press. Part of this is because 99% of people haven't pressed much so they need to play a little bit of catch up. I love when people tell the world, "My lifting responds really well to lots of volu me:' Meanwhile they are essentially playing catch-up for years of doing nothing but KB swings and mobil ity work in search of the grandiose 135 pound press. Boring But Strong tends to be easier to recover from than BBB , but that doesn't mean it isn't stressful, especially in the squat and deadl ift. BBS works best when paired with the 5's Progression.

Because the suppleme ntal work is less challenging during the first cycle, we will go full-out with the assis tance work. I want to keep the assistance work fairly high at this point, jus t to prepare your body for the final cycle; this is the roadwork needed for this challenge. Generally, I do not recommend the high-end of assistance work dur ing a Leader template because of the higher amount of volume of supplemental

136 I 5/3/1 FORE VER work. But since this is a challenge, things are a bit different. And since this challenge is different than the BBB challenge in terms of soreness and recovery, we can press the assistance a bit more . . Do I need to mention that you need to be smart about this? You'll get a feel for the work and volum e on the first week, so don't be an assistance queen and ruin your main work. Choose the exercises that won't derail your progress. You may have to be extra careful with a lot of low back work (back raises, for example). After the first cycle is finished you raise your training max for each lift. The second cycle uses 70% for the supp lemental work. This will be a little more intensive (obviously) but still completely doable, provided you choose the correct training max at the beginning. I had the privilege to be coached by Homer Smith while at the University of Arizona. He was the offensive coordinator and is literally the man who wrote the book on offense. This guy had been around foot ball for decades and coached at Alab ama, West Point, UCLA and for the Kansas City Chiefs. Smith came to Arizona a well-seasoned veteran, and at our first team meeting with him, he stressed the importance of starting correctly, in this case footwork. If you don't have the correct footwork down, you have much less of a chance to be successful. Every player at every position had to be exact - this ensured that the starter and every back up did the same exact footwork that a play called for. So my footwork for running an off-tackle zone play was the same as Trung Canidate. (To use an analogy, if we were musical bands, Trung was the Beatles and I was the ju nior high garage band with a zit-faced singer.) The lesson here is no matter what you do, start correctly, do it right and maximize your chances at being successful. With the 5/3/1 program, it is essential that you choose the correct training max.

This might be a little more feasible during the first cycle, but it also depends on the exercises you choose. It's easier to su perset curls and band pul l-aparts than dumb bell rows. So choose the assistance exercises that you want to do and give you the best chance at completing the challenge. Once again, increase your training max after you are done with the second cycle.

I recommend using BBB for two lifts and BBS for the other two. Whi chever lifts you choose, I highly recommend changing your training schedule so that you perform the BBB lift at the end of the week. BBB elicits a great amount of soreness and this is better done at the end of the week where you have more time to recovery. This is jus t common sense. I don't recommend this variation for anyone but someone fairly n�w to lifting - the more miles you have, the less effective this will be.

BORING BUT STRONG I recommend doing no more than two days of hard conditioning while using Boring But Strong. This goes for ANY template in this section. You should do a minimum of four days of conditioning. You can do some conditioning work on any day that works for you and your sched ule. Following two to three cycles of Boring But Strong, I recommend you switch templates to any of the following for an additional two to three cycles. Remem ber that we are looking to program a total of four or five total cycles at one time. • 5's Progression, Jokers and First Set Last. • PR Set and First Set Last. • PR Set, Jokers and First Set Last. • 5/3/1 and Widowmakers. • 5's Progression and First Set Last. • Full Body, 5's PRO. • Full Body, PR Set. • Beyond, FSL. • Original 5/3/1. SUPPLEMENT AL HEAVE N It's no secret that lifters love using different movements to help raise the main movements (squat, deadl ift, bench press and to a lesser degree, the press). Some of these supp lemental movements work extremely well for increasing/ carrying over to the main lifts. And, let's face it, others just feed the ego. Each of them has its place; sometimes we ju st want to lift like Thor and other times we ju st want to feel like Conan. Wh atever side you fall on, sometimes it's good to push an alternate lift for a couple cycles. This keeps the training fresh, keeps you motivated and will allo w the long-time lifter the chance to set some PRs.

SU PPLEME NT AL HE AVEN I 143 The key to doing a different suppl emental lift is finding where you cu rrent strength is with that move ment. This allows you to program that movement effectively in the 5/3/1 program. And here lies the confusion - people get upset when they have to take a workout to find their estimated lRM or even to get an idea of their strength. I do not understand this at all . If you want to do something, you should do it correctly. So if you don't know where you are on deficit dead lifts, take a delo ad week, use that movement in place of the dead lift and give it a shot. It won't derail your training and you'll actually be doing yourself a huge favor in the long run. There are any number of supple mental movements you can do - for the sake of simpl icity we will choose four supple mental movements: floor press, incline press, front squat and deficit deadli ft. Each of these will be done after the main movement (squat, deadl ift, press and bench press). You can choose to do these with any 5/3/1 program that has suppl emental work; BBB , BBS, FSL, SSL and many others. So when looking at this book, you can choose to do a different suppl emental move ment. The same basic rules apply - establish a training max for each movement and increase the training max the appropriate amount after each cycle. The one thing I must mention is that for you to get any benefit from these new movements, I recommend sticking with them for at least two cycles. This would be the bare minimum. SXS/3/1, SUPPLEMENT AL This variation allows you to push the supple mental lift quite hard. The main movement will still be done, but with 5's PRO or by working up to your training max for 3-5 reps. This template will begin a new four to five cycle program. I recommend doing this for three cycles, so you can fully realize the new movements with better technique and ju st get used to doing them. However, you can do this for only two cycles. The supplem ental lift will be done with 5x5/3/1 programming (as seen in this book). I recommend using a training max of 80% for the supple mental movement. For the main movement, you can use a training max of between 85-90%.

Not great for advanced lifters looking to push their strength. • Want to squat three times/week? This is for you. Bad knees or back? Not for you. • 85-90% TM. This is the most used /most popular 5/3/1 full-body template. This is mainly because it is easy to follow and it has been around the longest. The premise is simple: you train three days a week and each day you perform a squat, some kind of push and some kind of pull. This can be a lot of work for some people, so don't choose a template ju st because it looks good. Choose a template that will challenge you and one that you can handle. Below are the ones that I recommend. Rememb er that the following templates are all Leader templates and will only be done for 2-3 cycles. I recommend always doing the squat first in the workout, unless you are using a template that uses the power clean. I enjoy these templates, but it should be known that the cu rrent trend of "full-body" templates is exactly that: a trend. The full-body trend is mostly suppor ted and perpetrated by the "anti-drug" crowd. They assume and preach that lifters of yore, who never could have used drugs, used full-body templ ates and, thus, so should you. They fill their articles and books with grainy black and white pictures of shirtless men from decades ago. I always question someone who keeps pictures of old, almost naked du des and then has no prob lem putting them in an article with their name on it. However, the real problem is they are fucking lying. They have NO IDEA what they did and most of what they read about these lifters is based on magazine articles - which are full of shit-dipped lies. Most of the magazines of today, or yesterday, are there for two reasons: sell supple ments and sell advertising space. Basing your entire training program on what was being used to sell protein powder is pretty sil ly. And nothing is funnier than the "anti-drug" crowd who will sell their sou ls to sell their agenda. Ful l-body templates in the 5/3/1 program don't work any better than any other 5/3/1 template: What matters is that you give effort and you belie ve in what you do. Anyone who sells you on "training days" and not "training princip les" is, at best, an idiot and, at worst, a parasite.

146 I 5/3/1 FOREVER Full -body training is best for those that have limited time and for beginners and intermediate lifters. Some advanced lifters do use full-body templates, but for the most part, they stick to one lift per day. I should point out that the majority of 5/3/1 templates are technically full body, however they don't include full body in terms of barbell movements. FULL BODY 1 The first full-body template uses Second Set Last, First Set Last and 5's PRO for the main lifts. This template is one of the easiest to recover from.

In general, I recommend people usi ng lighter weights for the straight leg dead lift (SLD L) - the two main reasons are safety and form issues. Too many people do SLDL.'.s with too heavy of a weight, and it ends up looking like a dead lift. The pull should be done with the lower back and hamstrings, not the quads. This doesn't mean your knees should be comple tely straight. It means that the quads are used to stabi lize the legs, not to raise the bar.

You won't use hard conditioning with this template; how ever, it is imperative that you use the Ai rDyne to help deal with the soreness. This template must be done with an 85% TM. You must also be smart with your assistance work: I recommend only using triceps pushdowns or bodyweight push-ups/dips for your "push" movement. For your pulli ng movement, be sure to only use face pull s or band pul l-a parts. Your single leg/core assistance work should only be abdominal work.

If you are already doing chin-ups and rows in the template, then remove these exercises from the cache. I recommend curls, face pulls and other similar movements. You are free to pick any push ing movement. Remember that you are doing a lot of work in the main lifts, so you have to be smart when choosing your assistance. The single leg/ core movements are a bit restricted due to the amount of squatting. I would only rec ommend doing some abdominal , low back or some KB work. Leave out the single leg work. If you are doing some of the deadl ift-centric templates use only abdominal work - leave out the KB and lower back work.

FULL BO DY: SQUA T, PUSH, PUL L - ANCHOR I 15 5 CO NDITION ING. FULL BO DY: SQ UAT. PUSH. PULL Some of these templates are much more intensive than the others. With this in mind, you need to be wary of doing too much hard conditioning du ring this time. A lot of time on the Air Dyne would serve you well. This will help you recover and remain in great shape. Use some common sense! • 2 days of hard conditioning. • 3-5 days of easy conditioning. PUL L BO DY: SQ UAT , PU SH.

One of the little tricks I have used to program the SLDL is to use your bench press numb ers for your SLDL. In general, I would use sets of 10 reps for all the work sets and do 1-3 sets of 10 at the top set of the day. So if your bench press workout was 21 0x3, 240x3, 270x3, you would do the SLDL with: • 210x10. • 240x10. • 270x10 for1-3 total sets. This doesn't always work, but it is a simple way to do your SLDL work and have a plan. Make sure you are switching to 3/5/1 .

You can choose to do hard conditioning only two days provided you are using the other days to for easy conditioning. • Leader template. • Good for size and strength.

I really like both the Leader and Anchor templates for this variation as it combi nes a lot of good su pplemental work and does so without being too ignorant. This combines strength and size and does so without compromising much. This can be done as a four-day/week template, but you may have to be honest with yourself and use a three-day/week format, repeating each workout every nine days. There are no gold medal s for trying. So do it in such a way that you have success.

I can't stress that enough. Like most templates, you can choose to push one or more lifts with the above sets and reps.

16 4 I 5/ 3/1 FO RE VER ORIGINAL S/3/1 Even with all the different programming options with the 5/3/1 program, the original, for me, is still the best. I almost always try out the programs myself but as I've gotten older and opened my weight room to others, I am able to experiment on them. I even have a group of friends that allow me to experiment with them - so I have trusted sou rces to push new ideas and templates. Wh ile it's fun to do different things and try new ideas, at some point you ju st have to go where your heart and mind want to go. And for me, that is rooted in the original 5/3/1 program. The big draw of the program for me is the mental and physical pressure the original program puts on me. I like it. I thrive on it. My life, and I'm sure many of you reading this can agree, is fucking easy. We are out of the food chain, and we don't even need to leave our homes to protest something. So i don't think it's too much to ask my body or mind to do something hard or challenging a few times a week. I feel like this keeps my teeth sharp. It keeps a connection to my mind and body. It keeps me from getting too soft. I still get nervous before a PR set, and I love that feeli ng. I love not knowing. I love/hate not getting a PR -it's disappointing and I get upset, but at the same time, not succeed ing is part of training, part of life. Sometimes no matter how hard you work, you don't win. Hard work doesn't entitle you to anything other than doing hard work. Sometimes it pays off, other times it doesn't. But I can assure you, a.cross the board, you work hard enough and you'll be better off than you were before. Maybe not a champion like others, but a better YOU. At the same time, when I do get a PR it helps set the tone for my week, my day, my month. It helps to establish a mindset of setting a goal and achieving a goal. Of putting your mind and body to the test and getting something done. It's not about squatting X amount of weight anymore - it's about the work to get there and the accomplishment of doing something better/more than last time. And as time goes on, you realize you don't always set a PR. They become fewer and farther between. But the work dur ing every workout will, eventuall y, lead to a new personal best, be it weeks or months later. The original 5/3/1 program, at least on the su rface, doesn't lend itself to many of the same ideas as listed in the other templates/programs in the book. This is especiall y true when looking at Leader and Anchor templates. But it can work with a few tweaks and modifications. The most obvious way is to increase the volume of assistance work for the first two to three cycles and reducing it for the final two to three cycles. To refresh your memory, the original 5/3/1 program is laid out like this: MDNU THURSDAY WarM-up/Mobi/Hy WarM-up/Mobiliiy WarM-up/Mobiliiy WarM-up/Mobiliiy Ju1nps/11irows Ju1nps/11irows Ju1nps!Throws Ju1nps/Throws S'l"a+ &nch Press J)eodlif t Press Assistance Assistance Assistance Assistance

The sets and reps for the main movements (squat, bench press, press and dead lift) are as follows: _, .. �Q 65"/o x 5 r5"/o x 5 85"/o x 5+ WEBKTWD 10"/o x 3 80% x3 90"/o x 3+ WllKTHRBI 7-5"/o x 5 85"/o x 3 95"/o x 1+ Obviously there are some warm-up sets done prior to ttie main sets, but you get the idea. On the final set, you shoot for a PR set. You try to do more reps at the given weight than you have before, or using the estimated 1RM formula, you try to beat your old estimated max. After the third week, you increase your training max by 10 pounds for the squat/deadl ift and 5 pounds for the bench press/ press. Nothing changes to the original program. With this first option, for the first three cycles, you can increase the level of assistance work. So you can do something similar to this: • Push -1 00 total reps/workout. • Pull -1 00 total reps/workout. • Single Leg/Core - 100 total reps/workout. For the final two cycles, you would decrease your assistance work. • Push - 50-75 total reps/workout. • Pu ll - 50-75 total reps/workout. • Single Leg/Core - 50-75 total reps/workout. Everything remains the same with the main work, jum ps/throws and conditioning. The only thing that changes is the amount of assistance work. The second option is tweaking the main lifts slightly. Originally when I tried this, I admit to bei ng somewhat hesitant, but it worked well for me, was a small change and worked for others as well. It was enough of a change to keep things interesting.

166 I 5/ 3/1 FOR EVER The schedul e of the training remained exactly the same. But the main lifts were changed to this: WEEK ONE 65% x 10 75% x 5 85% x 5+ WEBKTWD 70% x 10 80% x5 C/0% x 3+ WEEKTHREB 75% x 10 85% x5 95% x 1+ The final set was always pushed hard, but the goal was to get at least ten reps on the final set. That was the goal - this kept me focused on the final set and gave me a true goal to shoot for. Obviously you must choose the correct training max. So you may choose to have a goal for the final set, depending on the week. That is up to you - use your experience to help you choose. Once you've done two to three cycles of this, you go back to the normal 5/3/1 program. With this variation, we kept the assistance the same for all five cycles: • Push - 50-100 total reps/workout. • Pull - 50-100 total reps/workout. • Single Leg/Core - 50-100 total reps/workout. The third option is running an A/B style of programming - this is much more intensive than the stan dard program and is not for everyone. This is a three-day/week program. • "A" Workout - Squat/Bench Press. • "B" Workout - Deadl ift/Press. Nothing changes with the sets and reps; you still push hard on the last set to set a PR or to hit a goal number of reps for the day.

This would be done for two to three cycles and then the original 5/3/1 program would be done. The assistance work for this cycle would remain the same througho ut. • Push -50-100 total reps/workout. • Pull -50-100 total reps/workout. • Single Leg/Cor e -50-100 total reps/workout. The next variation would be doing the same A/B style of workout but using a different assistance work, similar to the first variation. So the first two to three cycles you would do a higher amount of assistance work and then decrease it for the remainder. This does get a little hairy though as the amount of work you do each day gets a little tough. Because of that, you can decrease the assistance work substantially in the final cycles. The closest 5/3/1 variation to the original program is the 5/3/1 Widowmaker template. You would perform 2-3 cycles of 5/3/1 Wido wmaker (Leader) followed by the Or iginal 5/3/1 program (Anchor). JUMPS /THRO WS, ORIG INAL 5/3/1 In general, I would recommend doing 10-20 total jump s and throws per workout. The high end is for those doing one main lift per day. The low end is for those that are doing two main lifts per workout.

168 I 5/3/1 FO RE VER However, if you are a beginner or intermediate lifter who has some good abil ity, you can use the higher end regardle ss of what you are doing. C:CNDITICN ING, ORIGIN AL 5/3/l Whil e the templates I listed have conditioning on the training days, you can always do your condition ing on the off days. You can do up to four hard days of conditioning, but if you aren't ready, this will catch up to you quickly. I prefer people to do the harder conditioning on their training days and let their off days be used for a recovery circuit. Remember that if you are really pushing the conditioning, it's advised you restrict the volume of assistance work on your training days. This will give your body time to adapt to the new level of stress and allow you to still make some gains on your main lifts. Dlll&INAL 5/3/1 AND FIRST SET LAST • Very basic programming - simple and to the point. • Great for those that love pushing for PRs. • Ideal for those who want to push their conditioning. • 85-90% TM. The Leader template in this program will be done with a 3/5/1 style of programming. As stated ear lier, you will go for PRs on the first and third weeks only. The second week (the 3x5 week) will be done without any PR set.

So please take note - this is not for other templates. The goal of this template is to increase your conditioning levels and continue to hit PRs on your big lifts. This is not for powerlifters, and this is not for people who base their self-esteem and training on a 1RM . This is how you train EFFECTIVELY and still in crease your base levels of strength AND really push your conditioning. We use this a Leader template. Honestly, I am fucking tired of people trying to pretend thatthrowing a bunch of exercises at a white board, doing them while a coach screams at you (note: coaching doesn't involve screaming) and not doing any thing remotely specific/smart or even intelligently planned is how you train. All this does is piss on the work that I and others have done in this industry and what we take seriously. This is a specific program designed to help you achieve the Prowler standard: 10, 40-yard Prowler walks/sprints with bodyweight in 15 minutes. This is the standard in my gym and for the surface on which we push the Prowler. So you will have to make adj ustments based on your own surface. At the least, you will see how we can program this into our training and do so in an intelligent manner. This is incredibly simple but it works. This program will last for three 5/3/1 cycles, training four days/week. Thus it will last a total of nine full training weeks, not counting the deload. You are welcome to take a deload week after the sixth week - this is up to you. The way this is programmed will allo w you to be fully rested, provided you do the recovery work (eat, sleep, hydrate and do the necessary mobility work on the off days). The weight used on the Prowler will remain the same for all nine weeks: 75% of your bodyweight. This doesn't have to be exact - I used about 78%. My wife used exactly 75%. Another guy used ju st over 70%. The key isn't to be exact but to get it in the neighborhood. WEEKS 1-3 • Training Days - 4. • Mobil ity/Warm-up - Agile 8.

• Jum ps/Th rows - 10-20 per workout. • Main lift - push for PR set/goal each workout. 51311 PROWLER CHALL ENGE I 171 Assistance/Conditi oning - The following exercises will be done in a circuit style fashion; the circuit will be done six times. This is to be done after your warm-up, jump s/throws and your main lift. The amount of rest between each exercise will be up to you; this is not the time to kill yourself but to familiarize yourself With the workout and how out of shape/in shape you are. • Prowler push - 40 yards. • Push - 10-20 reps. • Pull - 5-20 reps. For the push exercise I recommend something like push-ups, dips or some kind of dum bbell move ment (DB bench/incline /p ress). For the pull movement, I recommend chin-ups/pull-up s, rows (of any kind) or a lat pul ldown. You should not choose any exercise or movement you cannot do in a fatigued state or choose a weight that you cannot handle with total ease when tired. So bodyweight movements are your best bet. WEEKS 4-6 • Training Days - 4. • Mobil ity/Warm-up -A gile 8. • Jum ps/Throws - 10-20 per workout. • Main lift - push for PR set/goa l each workout. ASSIST AN CE/CON DITIONING Six times through with about a minute rest between each exercise: • Prowler push - 40 yards. • Push -1 0-20 reps. • Pull - 5-20 reps. You will then rest five minutes and perform the same circuit four times, using as much rest as you need between movements. Just get it done. For weeks 4-6, you can take one day and perform 20-30 minutes of the Air Dyne instead of the circu its. You can do the assistance work after the main lift but not done as a conditioning. We usually did this on the third workout of the week (usuall y on Thursday). This will give you a mental and physical break.

172 I 5/3/1 FOR EVER WEEK 7-B • Training Days - 4. • Mobili ty/Wa rm-up.- Agile 8. • Jum ps/Throws - 10-20 per workout. • Main lift - push for PR set/goa l each workout. ASSIST AN CE/CONDITIONING Ten times through with about a ninety seconds rest between each exercise: • Prowler push - 40 yards. • Push - 10-20 reps. • Pull - 5-20 reps. Aga in, you can take one day per week and not do the circuit work and just perform a simple Ai rDyne workout for 20-30 minutes. Assistance work can be done after the main lift {prior to the Ai rDyne). You don't have to kill yourself when you ride the Air Dyne - ju st keep a good steady pace and enjoy the fact that you aren't using the Prowler. WEEK S This week is your testing week -all your lifting, jump ing, etc. will remain the same. We are shooting for 10, 40-yard Prowler pushes with bodyweight in ·15 minutes. We generally will test on a press or bench press day. However at this point, your legs will be so accustomed to the Prowler that it can be done on a squat day too. Let me end this by saying that this works incredibly well - I have done this, or tweaks of this for a while now. And I've been able to do these Prowler workouts/circu its while wearing a 25-p ound weight vest. And this is after a major back surgery and with a lot of miles on my body. This is not bragging, as I know there are many, many people who are much stronger and in much better "shape" than I am. What I am getting across is that this can work, it has worked and you can raise your lifts and increase your conditioning if you do so with some intell igence and by gradua lly bringing your body up to speed. There are a couple things that I find crucial to this challenge: I Eating - shoot for 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight, all through whole foods. a Hydration - shoot for 1 gallon of clear water/day. 3 Sle ep - hit your sleep goals for the week. 4 Mobili ty work/recovery circu its done each morning and every night.

ORIGIN AL 5/3/1 CH ALL ENGE I 17 3 Some of you may be able to do this chall enge with a rather haphazard approach to the above - those of us who struggle can't leave this up to chance. None of these things require any talent - just the discipline and commitment to do what is necessary. OR IGINAL 5/3/I CHALLENGE This is a total template, includ ing the jum ps/throws, conditioning and assistance work for both the Leader and Anchor template. This is about as basic as it gets and combi nes three things I like: PR sets, the Prowler, running and bodyweight assistance work. This challenge requires that you are competent with bodyweight work and have access to a weight vest or chin/ dip belt. This chall enge is done with two Leader cycles and two Anchor cycles (4 cycles total). I based the Prowler recommendations on push ing the Prowler on the street in front of my house - your surface may differ greatly so make the necessary adjus tments. I can safely say that if you are dying after any of the Prowler sessions, you are either doing it wrong or in horrible shape. The goal of Prowler is not to make you sick or so tired that you can't function. The Leader template will be done for two full cycles - in this challenge a cycle will last two weeks. As always, make sure you are increasing your training max after each full 5/3/1 cycle. This challe nge begins with the person using a TM of 85% for all lifts.

COMBI NA TION TEMP LATE 11 77 ASSI STANCE, ORIG INAL 5/3/l CHALLENGE The assistance work will all be done with weighted bodyweight movements - I recommend using a weight vest or chin/dip belt. Use 10% of your bodyweight in the vest or hanging from the belt. So a 200- pound person would use 20 pounds. For the ab wheel, I recommend using a weight vest. The back raises can be done with a weight vest or holding the required amount of weight on the back of your neck/head. • Push-ups or Dips - 50 total reps. • Chin-ups/ Pull-up s (use any grip) - 50 total reps. • Ab Wheel or Back Raises - 50 total reps (for the ab wheel, wear the weight vest.

The combination template allo ws the lifter to use different supplem ental sets/reps for each lift. For example, Boring But Strong is great for me for building the press but not for the dead lift. Widowmaker sets for the squat help me physically and mentally-for the bench press, not so much. So this will allow you to piece together the most efficient suppl emental templates for each lift. The most pop ul ar supp lemental work to use is Boring But Big, Boring But Strong, Second Set Last, 5x5/3/1 and Widow maker sets. The most difficult thing about this template is sequencing the lifts for proper recovery. The harder the work is to recover from, Boring But Big for example, the more you want to put it at the end of the training week. This is ju st common sense, and it's never going to be perfect. So you have to be willing to compromise a bit.

178 I 5/3/1 FOR EVER In this example, we will use the following suppleme ntal templates: • Squat - PR sets, Widowmaker set. • Press - Boring But Strong. • Bench Press - 5x5/3/1 . • Deadl ift - Second Set Last.

180 I 5/3/1 FORE VER • Beyond, FSL. • Orig inal 5/3/1 . LIMITED TIME Th is template is for those that have limited time to train per day; any father, mother or anyone who has a demanding job is always going to have periods of their life where their training time is going to be limited. The goal of this program is to allot training time every day but do so in a very efficient manner. I also realize that not everyone has training as a top priority in their life. The key to this program is simple: where you are, be there. So when it's time to train, shut off your phone, leave the computer and devote your time to training. The same goes for your job or family or whatever you are doing: focus on that one thing and let everything else go. Easier said than done, I know. But any successful person knows that quali ty time devoted to a task is infinitely more import ant than the qua ntity of time. The two things that one must internal ize in this template are effort and preparation. Effort means that when you are training, you are giving your best effort and pushing yourself like a madman. Preparation is simple: you don't train unless you do the necessary warm-up. This is often overlooked by people who have limited time; they completely negate their warm-up in an effort to get more time actually lifting. A proper warm-up is essential for you to give maximum effort. So take the ten minutes prior to lifting in order to prepare the body. Much like all the other templates, we will program the training with a Leader and an Anchor tem plate: 2-3 cycles of each for a total of 4-5 cycles. We will use an A and a B workout for the lifting - this will allow you to train with an inconsistent schedul e and fit your training to your life. The goal is to get two lifting days, two assistance/conditi oning days and two mobil ity/jumps sessions a week. We will aim to train for no more than 40 minutes per day, sometimes as little as 15 minutes. For simplici ty's sake, we will structure the training with the following schedule: Liff !f ssiol-once/ Ju1nps Mobilifyl Condifo11i n9 Lif f Your sched ule may vary; jus t choose the days that fit your life.

Kroc rows are simple: after 1-2 warm-up sets of DB rows, you do one all out set for 20-50 reps with the heaviest weight you can handle for that rep range. Most people should be shooting for 30 or more reps. If you can do more sets after your all-out set, you did not do the movement correctly. It is a brutal work set that may make you sick; it is great for buildin g the upper back and grip strength. Perfect for buildin g the dead lift, bench press and press. We have some simple standards for Kroc rows: • Beginner -Yz bodyweight x 20 reps/arm. • Intermediate -Yz bodyweight x 35 reps/arm. • Advanced -Yz bodyweight x 50 reps/arm. These are simple standards to shoot for and what you shoul d expect for yourself. Things really start to change once you hit the intermediate level: your up per back-in size and strength-beg ins its metamorphosis. You get thicker. Your grip is no longer an issue and your stabili ty in the press and bench press becomes better. Your lockout strength in the deadl ift is almost always improved. Und erstand that you will need to rest between sets of each arm. LIMITED TIME, BBS The next option for a Leader template is to use a variation of Boring But Strong. You will pick two exercises to do the BBS sets and reps: either the squat or the dead lift and either the bench press or the press. In this example, we will use the dead lift and the bench press. You do not want to do BBS for two lifts in the same day; so you may have to change what lifts you do on certain days.

18 4 I 5/3/1 FORE VER LIMITED TIME. ASSISTANCE /JUMPS No matter which template you choose, the assistance work and jump s/throws will remain the basi cally the same. Each workout will begin with a warm-up; you can use the Ag ile 8 or something similar. After this, I recommend doing 10-20 total ju mps or throws; this will only take about 10 min utes. For the assistance work, we will use a variety of bodyweight movements in a circuit. The weight vest can also be used. The assistance work will consist of three movements: push, pull and single leg/ core. The push move ment will either be pus h-ups or dip s. The pull movement will be either chin-ups/pu ll-up s or inverted rows. The single leg/core can be any of the following: back raises, hanging leg raises, ab wheel, KB swings, KB snatches and a variety of single leg work. We will shoot for, at a minimum, of 50-1 00 total reps per category. This may change based on your strength, but the goal is to get a lot of volume in your training by way of bodyweight work. The other advantage of this is that it's easier to recover from bodyweight work and it can be done with lim ited space and equi pment. Here are some examples of what you can do for assistance work in this template: OPTION I • Dips x 75 total reps. • Inverted rows x 100 total reps. • Ab wheel x 100 total reps. OPTION C! • Push-ups x 100 total reps. • Chin-up s/pul l-up s x 50 total reps. • KB swing x 100 total reps. OPTION 3 • Dips x 50 total reps. • Inverted rows x 100 total reps. • KB snatch x 50 total reps/arm. OPTION 4 (WEIGH T VEST ) • Dips x 50 total reps. • Chins-ups x 25 total reps. • Bulgarian single leg squat -50 total reps/leg. There are a lot of options, and you don't have to stick to one thing or one movement for any length of time. The work is what is important. LIMITED TIME. CONDITIONING No matter what template you are doi ng, you need to do two days of conditioning. What you choose to do is up to you and what you have access to. After a warm-up (Ag ile 8, for example), you will per form 20-30 minutes of easy or hard conditioning.

192 I 5/ 3/1 FOR EVER THE WEND LER CL ASS IC This is how I structure most of my training. It should be noted that I'm a bit older than the majority of my readers and my body has put up with a lot of abuse. My main goal isn't playing football or increasing my one-rep max on any lift. I just want to push and challenge my body and my mind and be a stronger person. However, like most of you, I can't spend all my time training nor do I want to. So this template is bal anced and most workouts take less than an hour a day, many of them around 30 minutes. This template is specifically geared to be run with two Leader templates followed by a single Anchor template. Bar speed is crucial for me - I thrive on making sure each rep on the main lifts is fast, strong and perfect. My training max is very low: I don't need to handle heavy weights to get stronger. Instead, I use speed, consistency and some very hard weight vest work to help buil d my strength. Part of this is probably based on the fact that I've lifted heavy all my life and know what I need. The other part is that, as someone who has beat his body to a pulp in 40 years of living, I find it better to build my strength with sleds, Prowlers and the weight vest in addition to the barbell work. So while this may not be for a lot of people, I can say that, physically, I feel great. I'm in great "cardio" shape, the best since I stopped playing football, and even more important, my day-to-day life is better. I'm never sore, and I don't hobble around after a squat workout or find it hard to sleep due to my shoulder s. I may not be able to squat 700 pounds, but I feel stronger. Being strong in the weight room is a great feeling, but at a certain point, the ends no longer ju stify the means. Personally, I don't think this attitude is right for everyone - if your goal is to bench 500 or squat 800, sacrifices should be made. It's part of reaching any extreme goal; you do what you need to do. But at this point in my life, I can still be fairly strong in the basic lifts and be strong in other areas as well. And these other areas have improved my overall "health:' In short, I'm a better person because I have more ba lance in my training. Al so, under stand that with al most three decades of training experience comes the realization that I can get more out of five reps than younger lifters can get in hundred. And it is also physical ly/emo tionally harder on me - the amount of force and focus that I have (and others who have trained for a long time) in each rep is hard to explain. You can't teach this either - it jus t comes with experience. Every rep, movement and nuance is near perfect. I have learned a lot over the years, especially from competing in sports, about focus and performance. That is why I always get a laugh at the scream ing and hollering I see from younger lifters prior to a set. This outward display of emotion is doing nothing for their lifting. It is energy that is being let out - when it should be contained and focused du ring the actual lift. Ironically I learned this not from lifting but from my years throwing the discus and with some various writings of Benny Podda. Yes, that is an odd combination, but one must look further than lifting/training in order to get stronger. Finally, I want to emphasize that this training is not meant to run you into the ground. Und erstand that this specific program is designed to make you stronger but riot at the expense of drooling for three days after you squat.

WENDLER CLASSIC: OVERVIEW (LEADER) • 2 days of lifting (squat, bench, deadl ift, press). • 3 days of weight vest training. • 2 days of jum ps/throws. • 7 days of mobil ity. • 30 miles of Ai rDyne a week. THE WEND LER CLAS SIC I 193 The first two cycles you will be doing barbell work two times a week. The main lifts will be using 5x5/3/1 for the main lifts. 65% x 5 t5 "1o x 5 85% x 5 sefs of 5 reps tO"lo x 5 80°/. x 5 'IO"lo x 5 sefs of 5 reps t5°1o x 5 85°/. x 5 '15"/o x 5 sets of 5 reps If you are an older lifter and can make bigger jump s prior to your main sets, the following option also works well. 55"/o x 5 tO"lo x 5 85% x 5 sets of 5 reps t5°1o x 5 'IO"lo x 5 sefs of 5 reps 65"/o x 5 80°/. x 5 '15°/o x 5 sets of 5 reps Note: With 5x5/3/1, your training max can be no higher than 80%. It's always best to go under, rather than over. This is especiall y true dur ing this particular training program. The actual barbell training will be done two times per week.

Wa lking for several miles while wearing a heavy vest is easy on the joints and, when wearing 100 pounds, is great for your back and abdomi nals. But about two years ago, I began using the weight vest as part of my lifting and it became an integral part of my training. The weight vest, at least how it's used in this training program, combines both strength and condi tioning. While it's not the brute strength that is developed by heavy barbell work, you still have to be strong to perform the work. And you also have to be in pretty good shape to get through it. I have developed standards and what I have du bbed the WaLRUS challenge. The name came first; the Wa LRUS is the fat, less intimidating cousin of the Navy SeAL. However, myself and my friend, Joey Waters, came up with an appropriate acronym: Washed up, Lethargic, Retired, Used, Sportsmen. The Wa LRUS is able to fulfill any middle aged physical task: shoveling snow, playing baseba ll with a 10 year old, mowing the lawn, sitting through horrid piano recitals and pretending to listen. These are elite subu rban commandos. While thi_s is obviously a joke, the Wa LRUS chall enge is not. There are three challenges. The first two have the same basic structure and use the weight in the vest as the variable. The third challenge's variable is the weight of the kettlebell while the weight vest remains the constant. 50 push-ups 25 chin-ups 50 J3ul9orian S'luofs/le 9 50 push-ups 25 chin-ups 125 S'fUtlfs 50 push-ups · 25 chin-ups 50 l(J3 snaf ches/ arm Note: Each challe nge must be done in 30 minutes or less. The chin-ups/ pull-up s can be done with any grip you want. The squats in the second chall enge are jus t bodyweight squats done with the weight vest.

THE WENDLER Cl.,ASS IC I 195 The challenges use a military-style ranking to determine your place. For the first two challenges, the standards are determined by the weight used in the vest. • 2nd Lieutenant - 25 pounds . • 1st Lieutenant - 35 pounds . • Captain - 45 pou nds . • Major - 55 pou nds . • Lt. Colonel - 65 pou nds . • Colonel - 75 pou nds . • General - 85 pounds . The third challe nge is done with 10% of your bodyweight in the vest. So a 200-pound person would use a 20-pound weight vest. The ranking system is determined by the weight of the KB. • 2nd Lieutenant - 35 pounds . • 1st Lieutenant - 44 pounds . • Captain - 53 pounds . • Major - 62 pound s . • Lt. Colonel - 70 pounds . • Colonel - 80 pounds . • General - 88 pou nds . WEIGHT VEST TRAI NING While these are the testing standards, the training is much different. Like the barbell training, we keep the training sub-maximal. The training mirrors the challenge s with the difference being the weight you use. You can choose whatever weight vest training you want: I have no rhyme or reason to which workout I perform. I do whatever I want on that day. When training, I recommend the work done in a circuit style fashion and finish in 30 minut�s. For example, you do a set of push-ups for 10 reps, followed by a set of chin-ups for 5 reps followed by a set of one-leg squats for 10 reps/leg. You do this for a total of five times through. Rest as much as you want between exercises; ju st get it done in 30 minutes. Don't try to rush and finish in record time. That defeats the whole purpose of this entire training program. I started doing this with 10% of my bodyweight and slowly worked up. Now I can finish the first two circu its with 45 pounds without much trouble. Als o, the KB circuit can easily be done with a 53lb KB. I did not start at this point - remember start too light. I must note that I am NE VER tired when doing this. I am sweating and winded but I am never "on the floor:' All the reps are strong and fast. So if you choose to do this, work up slowly and this should, AT ALL TIMES,

196 I 5/3/1 FOREVER be a workout, NEVER A TEST. I can't emphasize that enough. Start very light and work your way up slowly. In fact, when I completed the WaLRUS challenge with 75 pounds, my training was all done between 25 and 35 pounds. So don't be that guy that thinks, "if I add a pound every workout to my weight vest, I'll be able to do this with 100 pounds in ju st a few months'.' If anything, add a pound only if you can easily do these circuits in less than 20 minutes. The point is this: don't be an idiot. This is training, not testing. If in doub t, work yourself so that you can consistently use 10% of your bodyweight in the vest dur ing these challen ges. This seems to be the sweet spot when this work is combined with barbell training. It is important that this work be combined with barbe ll training, as they seem to complim ent each other. Doing 50 one leg squats/leg with a 751bs vest is easy when you squat 400x20 reps. It becomes difficult when you only squat 225. Remem ber that the third challenge is done with 10% of your bodyweight in the vest. So the training shou ld be done with 10% and the weight of the KB changed to reflect training, not testing. This too is done in a circuit. Feel free to use dip s in place of push-up s du ring the training, but not all the time. Al so, use what ever grip you want during chins/ pul l-ups. It ju st doesn't matter. You can choose to test yourself and where you rank on the WaLRUS scale dur ing the deload, between the Leader and Anchor template. However, you don't have to test. AIRDYNE /MOB ILITY The final part of the Wendler Classic is the Ai rDyne. The goal is to ride at least 30 miles/week. In general, I will ride for 20-30 minutes at a time. This can be done at any time du ring the week: I rec ommend doing this in the morning or night or even prior to any of the lifting or weight vest sessions. Like everything else, I ride hard but I never kill myself. The key is doing the work and being consistent. You do the mobility work every single day, and along with the Ai rDyne it will contribute greatly to your recovery. WEND LER CLASSIC, AN CHOR Do this Anchor template for one cycle (three weeks). There are some changes to offer some variety in the training, but the goal remains the same: get stronger, get better. WENDLER CLASSIC: OVERVIEW (ANCHOR ) • 2 days of lifting (squat, bench, deadl ift, press and assistance work). • 3 days of sled or Prowler work.

WEN DLER CLA SSIC , ANCHOR j 197 • 2 days of jum ps/throws. • 7 days of mobil ity. • 30 miles of Ai rDyne a week. The Anchor template will use the Orig inal 5/3/1 programming.

SLED AND PROWLER TUB DAY Warm-up/Mobilify Sled /Prowler PRIDAY Warm-up/Mobilify Sled /Prowler SATURD Y Warm-up/Mobility Sled /Prowler You can choose to use the sled or Prowler on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. Like the weight vest work, it is imperative that you train, not test. The sled/ Prowler workouts should last no more than 20-30 minutes (not counting the warm-up/mobil ity work). I recommend you pull the sled forward and backward.

198 I 5/ 3/1 FO RE VER Like the Leader template, the Ai rDyne is used for 30 miles/week. Mobili ty work should be done every single day. Rememb er that this only needs to take 10 minutes and can be done at any time. Like every program, you end the Anchor template with the ]1h Week Protocol to make sure your train ing maxes are where they need to be. Remem ber that while 80% is the highest TM, you can choose to use a lower training max if it fits your training. • We ndler Classic Leader template x 2 cycles. • 7th Week Protocol, Deload (possible Wa LRUS test). • Wendler Classic Anchor template x 1 cycle. • Great for buil ding strength. LEVIATH AN • Can be taxing on the body, so be wary. • 85-90% TM. Leviathan training is very simple: in both the Leader and Anchor template, you always work up to your training max for a single. After this, the main work and suppleme ntal work is changed. But the premise is simple: work up and hit a single. The more experienced you are, the lower your training max. Al so, the faster you are (in regards to lifting), the lower the training max. I have found that the faster the lifter you are, the less work you need to do, but the more focused it has to be. Of course, the more people focused on the actual work and not jus t doing work, the better they woul d be, but that's always going to be a losing battle. That kind of work is only learned through experience. The younger someone is, the more answers they have �o questions they don't even know. So if you are a beginner reading this book, the one thing I hope you learn is that quali ty is always better than quantity. Five things done right is better than fifteen things done wrong. The Leader template has a little flexibility to it; so make sure you choose what is best for each of your lifts AND what is best for the overall program. Choose wisely.

This is never going to be perfect, but try to use some common sense. For example, don't do BBB or Widowmakers for the squat at the beginning of the week. Rememb er that not every lift has to be pushed. In this case, 3-5 sets of 5 reps @ FSL can be used for the supple mental work. For many people, this will allow the other lifts to be pus hed harder and, many times, this reduction of effort and vo lume will allow you to make gains. I've said this before: sometimes it's not what you do, it's what you don't do that makes a difference. Not every problem can be solved by swinging the hammer harder. ASSISTANCE, LEVIATHAN The assistance may vary greatly on this template, as it depends on what supple mental work you do.

For those not familiar with the idea of 2x2x2 programming, this is essentially two days of lifting, two days of mobil ity/flexi bil ity and two days of conditioning. The name of this program came when I drew up the basic template for a friend of mine it had a Lucifer theme to it.

202 I 5/3/1 FO RE VER FRIDAY SATURDAY Liffin9 Rexibility Condiiio11in9 Flexibility If you look a little more closely, the week charts out as "L, C, F, L, C, F'.' Thus this immed iately made me think of two things: the movie Angel Heart and the .Ghost song, Con Clavi Co� Dia. The latter is Latin so I went with that. As usual , the lifting part is divided up in a Leader and Anchor format. The conditioning and flexibil ity/ mobility work is a little more flexible, for lack of a better term. The Leader templates have two options - you can choose any option for any of the lifts. Remember that if you choose to do 5x5/3/1 the TM must be no more than 80%: ideally the more advanced lifter will use 70-75% to take advantage of speed. MON DAY Warm-up/Mobility S�uaf/ l!iench Opfio n 1: 5x5/3/1 Opfion 2: 5's PRO, 3-5x5 @ FSL THURSDAY Warm-up/Mobility J)ead liff /Press Opfion 1: 5x5/3/1 Opfion 2: 5's PRO, 3-5x5 @ FSL Don't be afraid to mix and match programming, jus t remember to pick the correct TM for each. In this program, you do not do any jump s, throws or assistance work on Monday or Thursday. And this is where the changes really begin. In general, I recommend doing two Leader templates followed by a single Anchor template. Because we are only training two days/week, you can elimin ate the deload week between these two tem plates. However, you may need it - as this is only recommended for older or advanced lifters, don't discount the need to ease off the pedal. I have noticed that the older I get, the more I need to back off in order to get ahead. Also, realize that the other two components of this program are not easy, so make sure that you use your head, use your experience and be smart about it. CON CLAVI CON DID, AN CHOR The Anchor template, regardless of what Leader template you choose, is going to be the same and I'm betting that if you've read most of this book, you can figure out what it is.

This is up to you. As with the Leader template, there are no jump s, throws or assistance work done on these days. CON CLAVI CON DID , PLE:XIBILITY/MDB ILITY This is where things get interesting. Done on Wed nesday and Saturday, this combines mobility work, ju mps and throws and the assistance work into one day. This can also help you recover from the lifting and conditioning. The key to doing this is to move briskly, but you should not turn this into a workout, or at least a workout that leaves you drained or on the floor. This completely negates the entire purpose of this program, and you do not need to being doing jump s and throws in an exhausted state. Since this is only for older or experienced lifters, I'm going to leave the judg ment to the lifter: you should know whether or not you are moving too fast. That is the one thing that all the books in the world won't teach you: experience is, by far, the best teacher. So make sure your body and mind are ready to perform the exercise: don't rush in order to fulfill some ignorant philosophy that death shou ld accompany every workout. This part of the program consists of performing 3-4 circuits of 4 exercises. You will do each circuit 3 times. I recommend having at least one jump or throw, one bodyweight/kettlebell movement and one mobility movement per circuit. The final exercise can be any of the three or jum ping rope or the Ai rDyne.

204 I 5/3/1 FORE VER CIRCUIT 1 • Jump Rope x 100. • Hurdle Duck-Linders x 10/side. • Chin-ups/Pull-up s x 10. • Med Ball Ch est Passes x 5. CIRCUIT a • Jump Rope x 100. • Spidermans x 10/ leg. • Dips x 10. • Box Jump s x 5. CIRCUIT 3 • Kettlebell Snatches x 10/ar m. • Pus h-ups x 20. • Hurdle Step Over x 10/leg. • Overhead, Backward Med Ball Throw x 5. CIRCUIT 4 • Ai rDyne x 3-5 minutes. • Hanging Leg Raise x 10. • Leg Swings with Band x 20/leg. • Standing Long Jump x 5. As always, make sure the mobili ty work is done slowly and with pu rpose. The bodyweight work should be controlled and perfect. The ju mps and throws shou ld be explosive and under control. There are an infinite amount of possibil ities with this, and an older, experienced lifter has a huge toolbox to choose from. The above is ju st an example of exactly what I've done in the past. Just be sure to choose things that help you, especiall y in terms of mobil ity work. CON CLAVI CON DID, CONDI TIONING The conditioning work is very easy to program: on Tuesday and Friday you will perform two condition ing workouts, preferably one after the other. The first will be a hard conditioning workout consisting of sled or Prowler work. The second will be an easy conditioning workout consisting of a weight vest walk or Ai rDyne work for 30+ minutes. Ju st make sure that the hard conditioning isn't killing you and the easy conditioning is done the same way: don't turn the aerobic work into anaerobic. The hard conditioning is usua lly done for 10-20 minutes and you are free to do whatever you want. Make sure you are doing a basic mobil ity/flexibil ity warm up prior to training. The Leader and Anchor conditioning and mobil ity/assistance circuits are not changed; so follow the same ideas and templates regardle ss of your lifting. The harder thing about this template is being dedi cated to doing the conditioning and the circu its. It's easy to get motivated to get in the weight room. Not so much for mobil ity circu its that involve box jump s. So if this isn't appealing to you, don't do it - choose another program. But for those of you that have the discipline to do this template, you will be pleasantly su rprised.

PREP AND FAT LOSS TR AIN IN G I 205 PREP AND FAT LOSS TRA INING If you feel like you need to lose fat, not lose strength and/or you need a little kick in the ass and improve your general fitness level, this is the program for you. This is not for beginners, and I only recommend experienced lifters attempt this program. If you've been training consistently and with some level of intell igence for five years, this plan is probably for you. Now I und erstand not everyone will want to do this. The big advantage to doing this template is that it will prepare you for ju st about anything. Even if you've been training for a while and haven't done enough prep work, this would be perfect for you. If you've been caught up trying to "peak" for the last few years and your recovery, conditioning and work capacity has dropped, this is for you. Many people have done this specific program, and they all say the same thing: After the first two weeks, they hate me. They send me nasty messages, "I hate your face" or "you're an asshole" are pretty common. After the third and fourth week, it completely changes. Their bodies begin adapting, and they feel great. At the end of the program, they feel amazing. They are in better shape, and their strength doesn't take a complete nosedive. I buil t this program originally as a prep program, but since developing it, many people have used this as part of a fat loss program. This happened merely by mistake, but it seems to have answered the age-old question of how to train, not lose strength and get leaner. You will lift four days per week, and the program lasts six weeks. There is an emphasis on building volum e without trashing your body, conditioning and preparing your body for the rigors of the train ing ahead. The point of all this is not to run you down, rather to buil d you up. WARM-UP At this point in your training, I assume most of you have done a variety of basic warm-ups for mobility and flexibil ity. If you currently have something you are doi ng, do it. You know better than me. But if you don't have a warm-up or think yours sucks, I recommend doing Joe Defranco's Agile 8. And I recommend you do it every day, not just the days you train. JUMPING Every day you train, you will do a series of 10 jump s or medicine ball throws prior to training. I recom mend keeping it as simple as possible: box jump , standing long jump and 2-3 different medicine ball throws. We usuall y use the chest pass, overhead forward toss and overhead backward toss.

So if your real or estimated max for a lift is 500 pounds, you will use a 425-pound max for that particular lift. Yes, this may seem low but every one that has used this protocol had much better success with a slightly lower TM. Trust me, it works amazingly well. The main lifts will use 5's Progression (5's PRO) and 5x5 of First Set Last (FSL). The point of the program is not to push for absolute strength or push for PRs on any set - that is for another time. What we want is to build is a tremendous amount of ability to do work, be balanced and be prepared. We will use a 3/5/1 style of programming for this prep program. WEEKS 1-6: ALL LIFTS Week 1 - 70%x5, 80%x5, 90%x5, 5 sets of 5 reps @ 70% Week 2 - 65%x5, 75%x5, 85%x5, 5 sets of 5 reps @ 65% Week 3 - 75%x5, 85%x5, 95%x5, 5 sets of 5 reps @ 75% You can change the days of the week to what fits your schedu le; for example you can squat on Monday and dead lift on Thursday. This does not matter so chose what is best for you. ASSIST ANC:E This is where things get interesting. As this is a preparatory phase, we will be striving to get your body ready. And the assistance work may be a little different than you are used to. We will be doing a set of assistance work, of various movements, between every set of the main exercise. This includes the warm-up sets, work sets and the suppl emental work. This works very well provided you commit to it. If you cannot get through this or struggle in any way, keep at it. You will be in better shape than you can imagine. This is not about turning your lifting sessions into conditioning sessions. Rather,

PREP AND FAT LOSS TRAI NING I 207 it is about training with the idea of raising your abili ty to work. So you should n't do a set if you are exhausted or breathing hard. Do not compromise technique or safety in the name of conditioning. Since you are an intermediate or advanced lifter, I have to rely on your common sense. Be smart. And let's ju st be honest •. if you are breathing too hard dur ing these sessions, you need these sessions. Let's assume you do about 3 warm-up sets prior to your work sets. I do realize that this varies greatly from person to person, but ju st play along. You can adj ust as you see fit. BENCH PRESS AND PRESS The first 3 weeks of the program, you will be doing 11 sets of the bench press and press on each day. This includes the warm-up, main work and the supplem ental work. Let's pretend a lifter has a TM of 300 pounds on the bench press. On his first week, his entire training workout will look like this: BXERCISE WEI GHT/REPS &nch Press 120x5 ('f0"/o) Face Pu/J 25 reps &nch Press 150x5 (50"/o) Face Pull 25 reps J!Jench Press 180x5 (60"/o) 1 Le9 Squaf (bodywe�hf) 15 reps/le9 &nch Press 210x5 ftO"lo) 1 Le9 Squa+ (bodywe�h+) 15 reps/le9 J!Jench Press 2'10 x5 (80"/o) Chin-ups/Pu/J-ups 15-20 reps &nch Press 210x5 (90°/.l Chin-ups!Pu/J-ups 15-20 reps &nch Press 210x5 ftO"lol Chin-upsl'Pu/J-ups 15-20 reps J!Jench Press 210x5 ftO"lo) J)J!J/KJ!J Rows 20 reps &nch Press 210x5 ftO"lo)

The most important thing to remember when doing this workout is that the weights on the assistance work are not that important. You don't need to be rowing a 200-pound du mbbell or doing swings as heavy as you can. What is important is that the work is being done. This will add up over time, so don't freak out when you aren't king of the swing. The assistance work above is ju st an example of what you can do. We always keep the rows and chins in the program as they are ju st too damn valu able. If you can't do chin-ups for whatever reason, you can use the inverted row as a su bstitute. You can su bstitute bodyweight lu nges for the one leg squats (Bulg arian) and band pul l-aparts for the face pul ls. Swings are an awesome assistance exercise, but I have also used (gasp !) KB snatches in their place. I can hear the groaning now about shoulder fatigue. Only do snatches dur ing the suppl emental (in this case, the 5 sets of First Set Last) and only when you bench press. Reps would be 10 reps/arm. We never add weight to the body weight movements. There is a time and place for doing this but this is not the time. ASSIST ANCE: SO UAT AND IJEADLIFT Much like the bench press and the press, we will be programming the assistance work right into the main lift. Some of this may go against the grain of what you've been taught, but bear with me - this works. Ag ain we will use an example of a lifter who has a TM of 400 pounds in the deadl ift.

Alternating chin-ups/pu ll ups with dip s and push-ups gives your body a bit of rest between the movements. Again, I will cut this off at the pass and answer the question that many people have: "Won't the chin-ups have an negative impact on the deadl ift?" The answer is simple: Yes, if you are weak as hell. Training is supposed to be hard and this is a prep phase. Suck it up. Your body adapts, you get stronger. That's how this works. Once again, you can use inverted rows as an alternate movement. Hanging leg raises, sit-ups or just about any abdominal work can replace the ab wheel. And you can adjust the reps on the assistance work for your strength level, as the above is just an example. If you are injured or cannot do a movement, simply substitute another bodyweight movement in its place. I cannot do dips, so I use push-ups as an alternative. The supplemen tal work increases to seven sets in the final 3 weeks of the program. In this case, you can simply add two add itional sets of any exercise for the assistance work. As for rest periods, I recommend going at a comfortable pace with no more than 90 seconds rest between each exercise. This can be dropped to 60 seconds when you feel good, but do not turn this

210 I 5/3/1 FORE VER into conditioning session. It's not about running yourself into the ground. It's about preparation. And remember you have 4 training workouts/week so don't sacrifice one day for another. CDNDITIDNING There is a minimum of two days of conditioning done in this phase-f our at the most. You can choose to do hard conditioning, preferably on the same day you squat and/or deadl ift, but I don't recommend it. I prefer that you do easy conditioning dur ing this phase. I recommend doing a weight vest walk (2-3 miles), Ai rDyne {30 minutes/workout) or, if you are fit enough, a 1-2 mile run. The keys to the conditioning are two things: recovery and getting your resting heart rate down. Easy conditioning is a better option for these two goals. But I also understand the need to do something a little less boring. If you choose to do the Prowler dur ing this time, I recommend not killing yourself. I generall y recommend using 1/2-3/4 of your bodyweight (this include s the weight of the Prowler) and push ing it for 10-12 sprints x 40 yards. This should take 15 -20 minutes. Again, don't run yourself into the ground. Bu ild the base with a solid plan. If you are throwing up or gasping for breath, you are doing it wrong. There is a difference in working hard and working yourself into the ground. There is always a time and place for that. This is not it. You can do the easy conditioning work on any day of the week, even on the off days. The point is to get it done. Everyone should be able to finish the above workouts, with the all the reps, in 45 minutes. This is the goal of the program. This doesn't count the Agile 8 and the ju mping/ throwing; it is only the lifting portion. This is a very basic level of fitness that every serious lifter/athlete should strive for. If you are either shocked or put off by this statement, I really think you need to increase your personal standards for being a strong person. Wh ile I understand there is a need for variety in training, if one were to take the principles of this six week program and use it exclusively, you would be hard pressed to find a more complete training program. It includes volume, heavy weights, proper bar speed, body weight movements, kettlebells, jum ping, throwing and mobility work: all done at a brisk pace without sacrificing strength for condi tioning. Each day you lift, you will be training your entire body with a specific emphasis on one main lift. I recommend this program to anyone that needs a boost in their strength, conditioning and ability to do the proper amount of work in their training. I understand that this specific template is not appealing to everyone, but this will help set you up for better results in the long term. Six weeks is not too much to ask. The Advanced Prep Program can also be used as a Leader template. You can follow this template for the Prep Program with any of the following Anchor programs (all of which can be found in this book): • 5's Progression, Jokers and First Set Last. • PR Set and First Set Last. • PR Set, Jokers and First Set Last. • 5/3/1 and Widowmakers.

• 5's Progression and First Set Last. • Full Body, 5's PRO. • Full Body, PR Set. • Beyond, FSL. • Orig inal 5/3/1. 5/3/1 STRENGTH CIRCUI TS I 211 5/3/I STR ENGTH CIRCUITS • Onl y for highly advanced lifters. • Onl y for lifters already in great aerobic shape. • Not for beginners. • If strength is the goal, this is not for you. • Must have perfect form in all lifts. • Must have full under standing of how to use the correct training max for each lift and be able to adjust it for exact goals. As noted above, the 5/3/1 Strength Circu its are not for everyone. Circu its are generall y for people who have been around the block a few thousand times and have a full unde rstanding of the training process. I don't know any well-respected and competent coach/trainer that would put a beg inner or untrained/ de-trained individual into a circuit with big lifts. In other words, don't do this if you aren't sure of your own competency levels. You can, or will, get hurt, and your training will suffer. I do not prescribe a training max for this program, as it will vary quite a bit from lifter to lifter. I can say that it should never be more than 80% for each lift. Also, understand that for this program to be successful, you must perform each and every rep with precision and speed. If you do this, your overall strength shoul d not suffer. Remem ber, this doesn't mean you are going crazy du ring each lift. It means you are focused on doing each rep with extreme pur pose-quali ty! Sandb agging your lifts in the interest of self-preservation is not recommended. Like every program in this book, we will have a Leader and an Anchor. In general, you want 1-2 Leaders followed by 1-2 Anchors. Personall y, I like to perform two Leaders and choose 1-2 Anchors the latter depends on how I feel and how I'm performing. The Leader template uses 5x5/3/1 for the main lifts.

The next workout you perform the deadl ift, press and weighted chin-up, also done as a circuit. You alternate workouts in an A/B/ A, B/ A/ B fashion. One week you will be doing the squat/bench twice and the dead lift/press once. The following week will be the dead lift/ press twice and the squat/bench once. Very easy to follow. Each circuit is preceded by a warm-up and jum ps/throws.

STRENGTH CIRC UIT, EXAMPLE WOR KOUT Wa rm up each lift (can also be done in a circu it, but this is up to you). After the warm-up, perform five circuits with the appropriate exercises. In this example, we will be doing the first week of the 5x5/3/1 program with the squat, bench press, and rows. The weight, reps and type of row are up to you. CIRCUIT I • Squat - 1x5 @ 85%. • Bench Press - 1 x 5 @ 85%. • T-Bar Row - 1 x 10. CIRC UI T 2 • Squat -1 x5 @ 85%. • Bench Press - 1 x 5 @ 85%, • T-Bar Row - 1 x 10.

214 I 5/3/1 FORE VER CIRCU IT 5 • Squat -lx5 @ 85%. • Bench Press -1 x 5 @ 85%. • T-Bar Row -1 x 10. I highly recommend timing the first couple of workouts but NO T pushing them. Train at your own pace until you are comfortable with the set-up. Once you feel "comfortable" with the set-up, I recom mend you attempt to finish the five circu its in 30 minutes. 5/3/I STR ENGTH CIRCUIT , AN CHOR The Anchor template gives you a little more variety in your workout and exercise selection. Personally, the Leader template gets a bit boring, even for me. And I'm someone that rarely needs a lot of exer cise variety. Because we are pushing the lifts harder in the Anchor template, each core lift (squat, bench press, press and dead lift) is given its own day. However, each training day will have you performing three exercises. You have two choices for sets/reps. The first is for people that can still push lifts for PRs. The second choice is for older lifters that can get a lot of out of quality work and don't need to punish themselves. Obviously , if you are experienced enough to use the Strength Circu its, you already know which one is correct for you.

Much of this is going to depend on how your body feels dur ing the workout and whether or not you can push the FSL set.

As mentioned earli er, each core lift will have its own day. For the squat and dead lift, you will perform two add itional exercises: a push and a pull. For the bench press and the press, you will choose either two single leg/core exercises OR one single leg/core and one pull . In general, we will keep with the theme of assistance work and give you a wide variety of options to choose from. For the squat/deadlift, here are some of the exercises I have chosen. Feel free to add whatever lifts you want. General ly, I choose multi-joint assistance movements in order to get the best training economy. PUSH • Dips (weighted/unweig hted). • Push-ups (weighted). • DB press (bench, incline, standing). PULL • Chin-ups/ Pull-up s. • Row (any variety). Note: Generally, I never do a row movement when deadl ifting as this tends to fatigue my grip and lower back. For the bench press and the press, you can choose from single leg/core or from the pull category. Generall y, I take this time to make sure my abs and low back are strong and choose one low back and one abdominal movement. This is because I have done so much pulli ng in the Leader template.

216 I 5/3/1 FORE VER SINGL E LEG/CDRE • Ab wheel. • Hanging Leg Raise. • KB movement. • Any single leg movement. • Straight Leg DL. Si nce you are doing four work sets of the core lift, you will also be doing four work sets of the two addi tional exercises. The weight and the reps of the two addi tional movements are up to you. Aga in, you are an experienced lifter so this should never be hard to do. Make sure you warm-up properly before starting the circuit - you should be ready to train when you are starting your first circuit.

5/3/1 STR ENG TH CIRCU IT , ANCHOR I 217 STRENGTH CIR CUIT , ANCHOR , EXAMPLE WORKOUT Below is an example of a workout I've done as part of the Strength Circuit, Anchor. One of the keys to this style of training is to set aside these stations - something you might not have at busy commercial gym. The one thing you can always do is give yourself options on the assistance work. Commandeer the squat rack and if the T-Bar is cu rrently being used, use DB rows in its place. Be flexible! CIRC UIT l • Squat -1 x5 @ 65%. • Dips - 45 x 10. • T-Bar Row - 4 plates, 1 x 10. CIRCUIT C! • Squat - 1x5 @ 75%. • Dips - 45 x 10. • T-Bar Row - 4 plates, 1 x1 0. CIRCUI T 3 • Squat - 1x5 @ 85%. • Dips - 45 x 10. • T-Bar Row - 4 plates, 1 x 10. CIRCUIT 4 • Squat - 1x10 @ 65%. • Dips - 45 x 10. • T-Bar Row - 4 plates, 1 x 10. Again , there is no add itional assistance work after the circuit is finished. I generall y don't time the Anchor workouts due to the PR set and the Widowmaker set. However, if I'm using the second option (what I like to call the Five and Dime variation), I attempt to finish the workout in 40-45 minutes. We ight changes tend to add a lot of time to the workout, and I back off the "perceived rate of exer tion" du ring the Anchor template. CO NDITIONING, S/3/1 STRENGTH CIRCUITS If you are doing the strength circuits, you can choose to do whatever conditioning you want on the off-days. Much of this is going to be in your corner du e to the fact that you are a highly experienced lifter who knows exactly what his body needs. You know better than I what you need. With that said, if you are new to circuit training in general, back off the hard conditioning and use your days off to help you recover. This means either choosing easy conditioning or the active recovery workouts listed in the book. If your body adapts well, feel free to experiment. But always have markers in place that allow you to track your progress and overall well-being. This includes quality of sleep, resting heart rate, perceived level of exhaustion (during the workout and throughout the day) and mental clarity. I realize I'm preaching to the choir, but I still need to be reminded of the simple cues all of us must learn.

218 I 5/3/1 FO RE VER • Provides variety for each lift. S'S PIO FO REVER • Al lows each lift to be trained with different sup plemental volume. • PR sets are limited. • TM varies greatly. 5's Pro Forever is ideal for any lifter that gets wore out from doing PR sets. It is also great for a lifter to see what supplem ental volume (if any) helps drive progress in each lift. The big drawback is each lift is going to be different, and thus, you will change assistance work from day to day AND must account for it in upcoming workouts. In other words, a little foresight goes a long way. As you probably guessed, each main lift will be trained with 5's Progression. The only variation to this is using 5x5/3/1. The suppl emental volume can be chosen from the following: • Boring But Big. • Boring But Strong. • First Set Last. • Second Set Last. • Wido wmaker. As an example; let's say a lifter wants to use the following programming for each lift: • Bench - S's PRO, 5x5 @ SSL. • Press - 5's PRO 5x10 @ BBB. • Squat - 5x5/3/1. • Deadl ift - 5's PRO , 5x5 @ FSL. For the sake of simpli city, the lifter will train four days/week, training each lift once a week.

5'S PRO FORE VER , ANCHOR I 219 ASSISTANCE. S'S PRO FOR EVER Rememb er that if you are using a lot of volume for the squat/dead lift, you should cut back on the assistance volume of the single leg core. Al so, if you are doing a lot of volum e on the bench press/ press, cut back on the press volume for the assistance work. Just use common sense - you do a lot of one thing in your main lift/suppl emental, do less assistance. There are no hard and fast rules to the assistance work for S's Pro Forever, as much will be based on what the lifter chooses. For the above example, I would recommend the following: • Push - 25 total reps. • Pull - 2S-SO total reps. • Single Leg/Cor e - 2S-SO total reps. C:ONDITIONING, S'S PRO FOREVER Like the assistance work, this will be varied. In general, I would recommend no more than two hard days of conditioning and 3-5 days of total conditioning. Aga in, be smart and use common sense. 7™ WEEK PROTO COL , PR TEST After performing two Leader cycles, you would now move to the ]lh Week Protocol. Instead of deload ing, we will use this week to do a PR test. This will give you some relief from the high volum e and give you some real time results of your programming. Refer to the ]lh Week, PR Test part of this book on how this is done. S'S PIO POR EVIR , AN CHOR Regardless of what you choose for each lift in the Leader, the Anchor program will remain the same for each lift. The main lift will still be done with S's Progression. The supplem ental will always be SxS, FSL.

220 I 5/3/1 FORE VER ASSI STANCE, S'S PRO FORE VER, ANCHOR Again, the assistance will be up to you and will largely be based on what conditioning work you choose to do. The more conditioning, the less assistance you would do. The following recommenda tion would be for a "comfortable" amount of conditioning. • Push - 50-100 total reps. • Pull - 50-100 total reps. • Single Leg/Core - 50-100 total reps. CONDITIONING, S'S PRO FO REVER, ANCHOR Because we are doing 5's PRO, 5x5 FSL, we can also condition hard, but only if it fits your goals. I recommend the following: • 2-4 days of hard conditioning. • 3-5 days of easy conditioning. Under stand that 5's Pro Forever gives you a lot of flexibil ity for each lift as well as keeping things as simple as possible . I really like this option for more advanced lifters who are in tune with their bodies and intermediate lifters who are trying to find their way around a plateau. It effectively keeps the main lift static and allo ws you to see what combination of suppl emental work helps build each lift. Just remember that nothing in training is an island. What you do for the squat WI LL effect your bench press; what you do for conditioning WI LL effect your press. Everything works together AND against each other. The more experienced you get in training and programming your training, the more you will realize this. And you will also realize that there is NO perfect training program for each lift - there will always be a compromise. It's just a matter of what you are willing to give up and what you are willing to do to make progress. TITANIUM KNICK KNACK CHALLENGE • Only for advanced lifters/athletes. • Have to be strong, in great health AND gr eat shape. • Must have SS Bar, Trap Bar and weight vest. • Have to understand how to manipula te the TM. • Must have complete control over your body and be able to lift in a fatigued state without ever compromising form. I think I've made it very clear that this template (challenge, really) is not for everyone. As the title states, it take titanium knickknacks to attempt this and even to get prepared for this.

5'S PRO FORE VER, ANCHOR I 221 If your main goal is to increase your strength on the main lifts, then ditch this idea. This has no real pu rpose other than to complete the work and live to tell the story. To make things easier, I will break this down into three different phases; each will buil d on the other. Do not jump ahead because you will pay for it. As far as I know, this chall enge is the first of its kind and there is probably a pretty good reason - it requires specialized equip ment and it is absolutely ridicu lous. The end goal of this challenge is to do the following: • Trap Bar or SS Bar - 2x bodyweight for 25 total reps. • Push-ups or Dips - 50 total reps. • Chin-ups/Pu ll-ups (use any grip) - 25 total reps. Done in 30 minutes while wearing weight vest with 10% of your bodyweight. As you can see, the goals require a lifter to have a great level of strength prior to starting. But, as someone that has come close to achieving this goal, I can tell you that while strength is the most important factor, your heart will feel like it is punching out of your chest when trying this. The weight vest smothers you between sets and it's hard to get relief. TITANIUM KNIC:KKNAC:K, PART ONE The prep period for this template will consist of two cycles of 5's PRO , 5x5 FSL done with Wa LRUS assistance work. (Note: See earlier in book for information on the WaLRUS chal lenge and training.) I generally recommend using 10% of your bodyweight in the vest for the first cycle and using 20% for the second cycle. Keep the Wa LRUS assistance work to 30 minutes, and make sure you are push ing to finish the total reps in the given time. Feel free to use the different variations to add some variety. I generally recommend using an 80-85% TM for the main lifts. Since you are an advanced lifter, you will know instinctively what to choose. For the squat and dead lift, I recommend switching to the Trap Bar and SS Bar. Get used to the different bars.

222 I 5/3/1 FOR EVER TITANIUM KNI CKKNACK, PART TWO The next cycle will consist of six days of training. Your TM will have to drop for the main lifts - no higher than 80%. You will train the big lifts the same way as with the 5/3/1 Strength Circuit, Leader program. I recommend going through this for one or two cycles. Your goal is to complete each lifting circuit in 30 minutes. This include s the work sets ONL Y - not the warm-up.

TITANIUM KNICK KNACK, PART THREE Now is when things start getting harder. You will be training six days a week, three days while using the SS Bar and Trap Bar while wearing the weight vest. Use 10% of your bodyweight in the weight vest for all the sets. Despite the weight vest not being that heavy, you will learn quickly that fighting to keep your chest up and back tight will take an enormous amount of work. The bench press and press will be taken out of training and replaced with push-u ps, dip s and chin-ups/pull-up s. Again , make sure you adj ust your TM to account for the weight vest. You will have to rely on instinct and common sense. Rememb er that we are training, not testing. So be sure to start lighter than you think. You already have the strength, this is just about getting your body prepared for the test, and for now, that involves your abili ty to get through the circuit and see how it feels.

You can perform the lifts in any order you want, but I usuall y start with the easiest lift first, as most can do ten push-up s or dips and move onto the squat/dead lift with little rest. You can choose to do dip s or push-up s and use any grip to do pul l-up s/ch in-ups. The above circuit is done five times, thus completing the requisite number of reps for each movement. Use a running timer and attempt to complete each circuit in 30 minutes. The off-days, I recommend using 10% of your weight vest for additional "easy" WaLRUS circu its. By this time, these circuits shou ld be a breeze, and I have found that the more time you are wearing and training (not ju st walking) in the weight vest, the easier it becomes to lift with the vest. Su nday can be taken off or used for easy conditioning or active recovery. After completing two cycles, I recommend testing. Do not take too many days off prior to testing - at the very least do the Wa LRU S training to allow you to keep your body ready for the vest work.

WI DOWMAKER CIRCUIT I 225 TITANIUM KNI CKKN ACK CHA LLENGE OVERVIEW • Part One -2 cycles. Four days of lifting of 5's PRO , 5x5 FSL. • Part Two -1-2 cycles. • Part Three -2 cycles. • Test. WIDD WMAKE R CIRCUIT • Perfect for those short on time. • Great for strength. • Good for those that want balance. • Consists of hard work, so be wary. • 85-90% TM. • Best done for 2 Leaders, 1 Anch or. The Wido wmaker Circuit does one thing that the other circu its do not do; it keeps the "strength the .strength:' Circu its are not good for those that are not very strong, since they sacrifice strength for shorter rest periods. In fact, circu its are a favorite for trainers and programs that don't know how to get people stronger; just run them into the ground and blame the short rest periods for their shitty progress. It's a buil t in excuse for horrible programming and worse coaching. This program can be done three or four days a week. If you choose to do it three days/week, all you are doing is repeating a workout every nine days instead of seven; it is very simple and ideal for those that have limited time to train.

The assistance work will be done in a circuit fashion and will consist of exercises of your choosing. I highly recommend that you avoid exercises that you are not familiar with or that hold a high potential for inju ry. The basic recommendations for the total reps done in each of the three categories are 50-100; und erstand that these may change based on the exercises that you choose. Feel free to change the total reps as needed. For the sake of simplic ity, we will choose dips, chin-ups/pu ll-up s and double KB Cleans as the three exercises. After the main work is done, you will perform the following circuit, five times: • Dips x1 5. • Chin-up s/Pu ll-up s x 10. • Double KB Cleans - 10 reps. For some adde d awesomeness, add in 100 jump s of jump rope to the circuit: • Jump rope x 100. • Dips x1 5. • Chin-up s/Pu ll-up s x 10. • Double KB Cleans -1 0 reps. Once again, the above circuit is done five times. If you want to spice things up, here is another exam ple of a circuit. This is a good variation for those that train in very cold winter areas and cannot go a lot of outside conditioning. Again , the circuit is done five times through. • Jump rope x 50. • Dips x 15. • Jump rope x 50. • Chin-up s/Pul l-up s x 10. • Jump rope x 50. • Double KB Cleans - 10 reps. Addit ional points of greatness can be added when you choose to wear a weight vest dur ing the circuits. I highly recommend starting with a light weight vest (around 10% of your bodyweight) if you

WI DO WMAKER CI RCU IT , ANCHOR j 227 choose to do this. Obvious ly, when wearing a weight vest, some of your exercise choices will be lim ited. For example, you're not going to be DB bench pressing with a weight vest on. This is common sense stuff, and why would you wear a weight vest to do DB Bench? I have no idea, either. As with everything in any 5/3/1 program, don't overextend yourself dur ing the first cycle of circu its. Keep it simple and start too light. Over time, you can add more reps or a weight vest. But don't think you are an Olym pic-trained athlete when you've spent a decade in a cubicle. Personally, I like to keep a running timer during the circuits. Once again, when you start, ju st do it at your own pace and see where you naturally finish. Over time, make it a goal for yourself to finish in a reasonable total amount of time. If you choose to add in jumpin g rope, be sure to account for this.

228 I 5/3/ 1 FORE VER OP TION I • Leader - SxS/3/1 + Circu its. • Anchor - S/3/1 PR sets, S's PRO, SxS FSL or S/3/1 Widowmaker (choose one) + circuits. OP TION B • Leader - S's PRO , SxS FSL + Circuits. • Anc hor - 5's PRO , SxS FSL, 5/3/1 PR sets or 5/3/1 Widowmaker + Circuits. OPTION 3 • Leader - S's PRO , Sx5 SSL + Circu its. • Anchor - S's PRO, SxS FSL, S/3/1 PR sets or S/3/1 Widowmaker + Circu its. CER EMON Y DP OPPOS ITES In honor of the band Samael (who I'm listening to at the moment of writing this), this program will be named after their great album. Essentially, this is a different way of programming your Anchors and Leaders and great for more experienced lifters. There is only one major change to the programming, but it can be very instrumental. There are three variations within Ceremony of Opposit es, but all have a Maintenance, Leader and Anchor. How you choose to program this will be entirely up to you and your experience. • Cycle One - Maintenance . • Cycle Two/Three - Leader . • Cycle Four - Anchor . • Cycle One /Two - Mai ntenance . • Cycle Three - Leader . • Cycle Four - Anchor . • Cycle One - Maintenance . • Cycle Two - Leader . • Cycle Three/Four - Anchor .

CEREM ON Y OF OP POSITES I 229 MAINTEN ANCE, CEREMON Y OF OPPOSITES What you do for your Maintenance program is going to be up to you. In general, you would use the lightest TM you need to maintain strength and speed and that allows your body to heal and feel ready to train. Usually the maintenance phase TM will be static - meaning it won't change based on what you did in prior cycles. Again, this is for more experienced lifters that know what they need and realize they don't need to operate on Level 10 to get stronger. For the sake of simpli city, let's say the lifter is doing S's PRO , and 3-5x5 FSL for this phase. The assistance is kept to 25-50 for each of the three categories, and the lifts chosen for assistance don't stress the joi nts and aren't taken to the extreme. There are many different ways to go about this phase but do not let your ego get in the way of progress. The conditioning du ring this phase must always be easy. This is the time to recoup and not the time to be killing yourself with the sled, hills or Prowler. Heal, brothers! Much of the maintenance phase will be structured so that mobil ity, aerobic capacity and health of joints/mind are front-and-center. In general, the maintenance phase is good for after a meet, an intense training cycle or anytime you need to get your body back on track. The key to this is doing ONL Y what is necessary and no more. LEADER /ANCHOR. CEREMON Y OF OPPOSITES As seen above, there are a couple different variations of how long to run each of the three phases. Aga in, this is up to the experienced and highly intell igent lifter. I normally don't like to give too many choices to younger lifters, as they don't have the experience and intelli gence to choose wisely. 30 years of training and common sense have told me that. But once you've got some mileage, made mistakes and had success AND you have the track record of making great decisions regarding your training, go ahead and change what you need. However, if you don't have a successful history, be sure to stick with 2 Leader cycles and 1 Anchor. SUPPLEMENT AL There are a couple of basic, common sense rules to adding suppl emental work to your training. These will help you decide when and/or if you should add a different supp lemental lift to your training. I Beginner lifters don't need to do a different suppl emental lift in their training. Keep the basic lifts, the basic lifts. a If you are an intermediate or advanced lifter, use a different suppl emental lift dur ing your Leader program and go back to the core lift for your Anchor.

230 I 5/3/1 FORE VER 3 If you are a competitive lifter, the closer you are to the meet, the less you will use a different sup plemental lift. If you are months away from a meet, feel free to add in deficit dead lifts and front squats. But as you approach the meet, use the core lifts for the supple mental work. 4 Don't go overboard on limiting or extending the range of motion of a sup plemental lift. In other words, even an inch or two can make a big difference to the mechanics of a lift. So there is little need to do a 6-boa rd press or a rack dead lift with 1" range of motion. i!Xi!X i! • Great for older lifters and people who have limited time. • Lots of options and variety. • Strives for total training balance. • TM is based on what option you choose. 2x2x2 is nothing more than dividing your time and training to three different areas: conditioning, mobil ity/recovery and weight training. Each week you have two days dedi cated to lifting, two days to conditioning and two days to mobility work. This doesn't mean you can't do extra mobili ty work or conditioning on your other days. Instead this gives each day a specific focus. You can choose to do the lifting, conditioning and mobil ity on any day; however, for the sake of sim plicity, we will use this schedu le. Liflin9 TUESDA Y WEDNESDA Y Condi'fio11in9 Flexibili-ly PRIDAY SATURDAY Lif lin9 Flexibi/Hy For the lifting, you can choose any of these options for the main lifts: BBB, BBS, SSL, FSL {5x5), Widowma kers or 5x5/3/1. You can mix and match any of these options during the Leader cycle. Because we are only lifting two times a week, we will increase the jum ps/throws to 20 per day.

I generall y don't recommend this for more experienced lifters due to time and recovery - for a younger lifter, this might not cause too much of a problem. Understand that nothing you do in the weight room exists independen tly. BBB might work very well for your bench press, but it may be too much to do after you perform a hard squat workout with a high volume of suppl emental work. These are things that must be experime nted with, and you must use your common sense and your experience. This is an important lesson to learn regardle ss of what training program you choose; everything works together and works against one another. Thus bala nce and proper programming requires something that you cannot buy or learn with in a book or seminar: your own experience. ASSI STANCE. 2X2X2 This is where things get very difficult. But, again, use some common sense. If you are doing a high amount of su pplemen tal volu me, you will have to greatly reduce your assistance work. Since there are so many different options that you can choose in the 2x2x2 program, the one general rule that I urge you to follow is to always find some time to do some kind of pull du ring each of the workouts. Rows, chin-ups/pu ll-up s, face pulls and band pull- aparts shoul d always remain in your training. These can be done in a super set fashion in between any of the main lifts. If you are doing BBB or BBS with the bench press or press, elimi nate or drastically reduce the press ing assistance work. If you are doing BBB or BBS with the squat or deadl ift, you should cut out the single leg work and lower back work for assistance. Abdom inal work can still be done.

232 I 5/3/1 FOREVER i!Xi!Xi!., AN CHOR The 2x2x2 Anchor programming is very straightforward and follows the basic rules of Leaders/ Anc hors. There isn't a lot of variety - main lifts are done for PR sets or 5's PRO. Supple mental work is either elimi nated or done with 5x5, FSL.

However, please understand that your goal is not to run yourself into the ground every training day, even if you are training two days a week. Fatigue doesn't mean progress, despite what trendy workout programs push on ignorant masses. ASSI ST ANCE, 2X2X2, ANCHOR Aga in, you will have to use some common sense when doing assistance work. To keep things moving, you can super set the pressing assistance between your squat and dead lift and do the pull ing assistance between the bench press and press. Finally, you can do the single leg/core work after the lifts are done OR with the press and bench press (along with the pullin g assistance). Below are my recommendations, but you may choose to do more/less based on your experience. • Push - 25-50 total reps/workout. • Pull - 50-100 total reps/workout. • Single Leg/Core - 25-50 total reps/workout. 2X 2X2, CONDITIONING This is probably the easiest part of the program. Choose a conditioning goal and work towards it with the gu idel ines and principles set forth in the Conditioning section of this book. You do not have

THE KRYPTEIA I 233 to do hard conditioning on these two days - do what you need to do. Also, you can choose to do easy conditioning days IN ADDI TION to the work you do on your mobili ty days. 2X2X2, MOBIL ITY There are many different options you can choose to do for your mobility day. The key is spending qua lity time on this part of the program. Dedicate at least 45 minutes to a quality mobil ity session. Even attending a Yoga class, or something similar, may do wonders for you. THE KRYPTEIA • Great for those looking to get stronger, get bigger and lose body fat. • Can be used with many level lifters PROVI DED they have gui dance and coaching. However, if you are new to lifting, have recently posted on an on line forum, look to social media for training answers, posted a "form check video" in the last year or use hype music, find another program. • Must have perfect form with all li fts. If you do not have perfect form, find a perfect coach. If you don't have either, do not do this program. • Must have basic training base AND be in reasonable shape. If you wheeze when taking a dump , find another program. • Not a lot of variety. So if you have training A.D. D., choose something else. Win ners don't need variety, they need results. Onl y losers get bored at progress. • No higher than 85% TM. Let's make this very clear; this training program is not for everyone. So if you can't do this program, do not attempt it or change it. Not everything is for everyone; one has to discriminate. This Krypteia is ideal for anyone looking to get stronger, get bigger and shed some body fat. It is not for those who do not have a good grasp of the basic lifts OR whose main focus is getting stronger. You can get stronger using this program (and many have), but if your focus is powerlifting, then I would not recommend it. This program is incredibly simple, but it involves a lot of work. So be sure you are ready to totally commit to the process. KRYPTEIA, PART ONE (2 CYCLES) This is the preparatory phase of this program. The first part of Krypteia training involves keeping the training as simple as possible. For the bench press and press, we will pair every set of the main lift with the DB squat and DB straight leg dead lift (SLDL). The SLDL is done with a shrug after each rep. For the squat and dead lift, we pair the main lift with weighted dip s and weighted chin-ups/pul l-u ps.

234 I 5/3/1 FORE VER For a heavier athlete that cannot do these movements, I recommend DB incline press and DB incline row. The DB incline row is done with the incline bench su pporting the chest. This elimin ates the strain on the lower back that mi ght occur with the traditional DB row. You should do no less than 10 repetitions for every set of assistance work. The only other exercise I recommend to do dur ing this program is 100-200 reps of face pulls or band pull -a parts. These should be done every day or, at least, every training day. No other assistance work is done with this program. Do not overthink this program. It is very simple - every time you do a set of a main lift, you pair it with an assistance movement. This is not complicated, so don't pretend this is spl itting the atom. The Krypteia preparatory program uses 5's Progression and 5x5 FSL for the main lift. Do not choose your training max until you look over the training and know what you can handle. The goal is to finish each trainin� day, not including the warm-up and jump s, in 45 minutes. If you cannot finish the train ing in this time, keep repeating Part One until you do.

Keep the assistance weights mod erate and let your body adapt. The second cycle, I recommend you push the assistance work a bit. Either increase the weight or increase the reps. One of the coaching cues of this training is to make sure you do not rush any set or any rep. Every rep should be done with a controlled eccentric phase AND an explosive concentric phase. Do not ju st do the sets to complete them. I cannot emphasize this enough. The goal is to finish the lifting in 45 minutes. This does not count the mobil ity work or the jum ps/throws. Anyone that rushes lifts, gives half-ass effort or isn't in complete control of each and every lift needs to find another program. I keep the training max (no more than 85%) the same for each cycle - the only difference is pushing the assistance work and making sure the reps are perfect and explosive. KRYPTE IA, PART TWO (2 CYCLES ) The second part of this phase has the same basic template. I recommend beginning the second part with same training max-yes the same training max-as you did dur ing the first phase.

THE KRYP TE IA I 237 There are three differences to the second part of this training program. First, we cut out the press. Second, we use a three-day/week format - training the squat, bench and deadl ift on a three-day sched ule. Finally, we will change the supplem ental programming. Instead of doing five sets of five reps, we will change it to five sets of ten reps (BBB). For younger, less experienced lifters and ath letes, you can use the First Set Last weight for the supple mental work. More experienced lifters can choose a set weight for the suppl emental work-usually much lower than FSL numbers. The assis tance work remains the same: DB squat and DB SLDL are super setted with the bench press. For the squat and deadl ift, use dip s and chins/pulls or DB incline and DB incline rows. Again, the assistance work will be done for sets of 10 repetitions.

Once you go through all the phases and want to do Krypteia again, you can simply leave out Part One. Make sure you choose the appropriate training max when you begin a new program; this does not change with this program. Essentially, this program has a preparatory program followed by two cycles of a Leader and once cycle of an Anch or. After you go through this once, you can move to another program or simply repeat. With the more aggressive lifters, I have them repeat the program with one small change: instead of alternating the assistance work, I will have them do one set EACH of the two assistance movements after one set of the main lift. Again , there is a 45 minute time limit. For example: • Squat - 5 reps @70%. • DB Incline Press - 10 reps. • DB Incline Rows - 10 reps.

• Squat - 5 reps @ 80%. • DB Incline Press -1 0 reps. • DB Incline Rows - 10 reps. THE KRYPTEI A \ 241 This variation is not recommended for everyone. This option is only for those that are willing to do the work and are in great lifting shape. Do not do this unless you are absolutely certain you can maintain your form/technique with the main lifts. Going over my notes, I have had three people do this out of the 75 people I've used this program with. So don't be in a rush to add this wrinkle. Finally, you must eat if you do this - this is not a time to be falling for trend diets. If you need to lose body fat, you still must eat enough to supp ort the work and building muscle. I cannot stress this enough. KRYPTEIA. C:DNDITIDNING I only recommend doing easy conditioning and recovery work. • 2-3 days of easy conditioning. I have used this with athletes and they do run. They have a long history of running, however, and all of it is done similar to how I program running in this book. If you are a strength and conditioning coach, you know your athletes and have the background to train athletes. So use your knowledge and experience. If you haven't run much or the last time you ran was to the bathroom, I recommend getting on an AirDyne on your off days. Combined with mobility work, you will be more than pleased with the results. If your running volum e is quite high or you are doing additional work, cut out the 5x10 work for the squat and deadl ift. Everything else remains the same. Also, we generall y use a lot more jump s and throws for athletes. Keep in mind it took us months to work up to increasing the contacts/throws. So start light and progress slow. General ly, most field athletes don't need more than 20-30 contacts/throws each training day. Once you get the hang of this style of programming, you can use this with BBS and SSL. However, I warn you to not overthink this too much. DO NOT start using different movements and assistance exer cises. I spent a lot of time perfecting and changing this program, and I will not sign off on any deviation or change. This program works. Generally, the legs, glutes, upper back and shoulders get much bigger. Al so, even when not eating specifically for "fat loss:· people generally get much leaner. Understand that the assistance work must be pushed for this to work and that is your responsibil ity. As an example, every kid that I've used this with who had a squat of 185-200 pounds did every set of DB squat with no LIGHTER than 851bs du mbbell. Assistance work can be done for more reps than 10, but no less. You must ease into this kind of training, so be sure you go through the preparatory phase and you unde rstand the commitment it takes to do this kind of training. Good luck and enjoy the process and the progress. I believe that this particular program can work for just about anyone outside of older lifters and strength athletes.

244 I 5/3/1 FOREVER CO ND ITIO NING Conditioning became much more in vogue in the weight lifting world about a decade ago; many years ago it was a four-letter word. But as usual, the pendulum seeks balance, so what was ignored is now being overdone with zero common sense. The amount of bull shit in the conditioning world is as bad as any other, and we have the trendy workout programs to blame: unquali fied morons with zero experience trying to coach physicall y unprepared adul ts into giving 10 0% effort into 100% stupid ity. It is the crowning achievement of modern fitness: know-nothings parading around as know-it-alls with all the cockiness and none of the experience. We can only hope for a deadly parasite. So let's look at all the mistakes that are common when conditioning is combined with weight training. NOT ACCOU NTING FDR THE CONDITI ONING IN YOUR LIFTING This is probably the biggest one. People somehow, and I don't know how the fuck this ever hap pened, think that the effort you give in conditioning has no effect on the lifting - and vice versa. I think it's important for people to compartmentalize parts of their life as this makes it easy for them to leave work at work and not bring their personal life into their careers. However, training is different. Everything ties together even if you don't want it to. There are people whose primary goal is to increase their squat, bench, press and dead lift who al low too much conditioning to interfere with their real goals. I'm not sure if this is a form of self-sabotage or ignorance. Conversely, I'm sure there are people in the running world (or something similar ) who do too much lifting and the same result happens. Now for someone who has both conditioning and lifting goals, this is where bala nce comes into play. The good thing is that it can be done, but there is always a sacrifice to be made. The question remains whether or not you are willing to make that sacrifice. CON DITION ING HAS ND PURPOSE, ND GOAL Another whopper thanks to the trends - just going out and running around with zero idea of what you are doing, why you are doing it and jus t hoping that if you get out of breath enough, something good will happen. There are literall y thousands of gyms and personal trainers, maybe milli ons, that ju st do a bunch of shit with no pu rpose. "Just go run around the buil di ng, come back here and do some push-ups, hit a set of deadl ifts and then run again:• This is common! These people get paid to do it - thus making them a professional. It's like a professional baseball player who plays everyday, has never made contact when at bat, commits an error every time a ball comes at him and yet man agement still keeps him under contract. Talk about enabler s. As for the 5/3/1 program and me personally, I divide the goals of conditioning into two categories: performance and consistency. The Prowler, the sled and running are based on performance. The easy, aerobic conditioning is based on consistency. So don't jus t push a Prowler so you can feel like shit for a day and think you did something: push it with a pu rpose and a goal.

CONDIT IONING I 245 NOT DOI NG ANY AEROBIC (EASY) CON DITIONING Regardle ss of your lifting and conditioning goals, easy (aerobic) conditioning should be done. It's not sexy and it's not terribly fun but the results are undeniable when paired with a strenuous training program. This was one of the big mistakes I made in training, and I'm hoping my mistake will help you avoid making it, too. The two main benefits are recovery and your overall health. Recovery works in two ways. You recover better between training sessions and between sets. This makes for better and more produc tive workouts. For me personally, the biggest change was never feeling drained after a training session. I know it's cool to think that every training session should be horrible and "lift everyday like there's no tomorrow" but we all know that this is jus t stupid. This doesn't mean you have to necessarily do more work, rather you can do the same amount of work and simply feel better. Just because you are in better shape doesn't mean you shoul d do more - a huge mistake made my many people. Just do what you do, better. Read that again and again. The health benefits are pretty amazing: lower resting heart rate and lower blood pressure. In the quest to get bigger and stronger, often one's overall health is disregarded in pursuit of these goals. And as someone who has spent over three decades in this quest, I can tell you that there are some drawbacks as you get older. Namely, your heart doesn't care too much if you are 225 pounds of muscle or 225 pounds of fat - it still has a lot of work to do. Being 225 when you are 21 years old is much different than when you are 40 - that's a lot of wear and tear on the body. And when you pair this with the amount of food you have to eat, it can become quite difficult. This is where the easy conditioning comes in - this is how you can prevent and cure a lot of problems. Mu ch like mobility, any bigger lifter will tell you the same thing, "lfonly I had spent three days a week, 30 minutes a day, riding a bike:' So do the work. If you are new to training and conditioning, don't try to run before you walk. This is literal and figura tive. Too many people are jumping in to harder modali ties without having the fitness background to support it. So if you are in this category or are training someone who is, they should n't be pushing a Prowler before they've bu ilt an acceptable aerobic base. The 5/3/1 program classifies conditioning into two categories: easy and hard. These are pretty rudi mentary terms to use, but let's shed some light on what makes something easy and something hard. Hard conditioning is anything that requires tremendous effort, often weight related, and compro mises your recovery from lifting. It requires an enormous amount of effort in your lungs and your muscles. In the cases of this program this includes the sled, Prowler, running hills and running. Easy conditioning is the boring, non-taxing conditioning work that can be done with little to no effort. While you might be a little winded, this requires little to no muscular effort. Of course if one is terribly out of shape, the easy conditioning can be taxing and, for a time, affect your recovery. However, once your body adapts to this it no longer becomes a problem. Each 5/3/1 program in this book has my recommendations for how many easy and hard condi tioning workouts can be done dur ing the week. But let me make this very clear and this should be obvious to ju st about anyone: you do not need to do hard conditioning work. However, you must do easy conditioning.

246 I 5/3/1 FOREVER HARD CD ND ITIDNIND I have a very simple rule when doing hard conditioning and you can apply this to any means you choose. I cannot emphasize how important this is and how much of a difference this can make when pairing conditioning and lifting. I call this the 50% rule or the 20% rule; the percentage doesn't matter nor is it exact. The principle of this rule is to perform your conditioning training in such a way that you leave something in the tank. Remem ber that there is a huge difference between training and testing - and this chasm becomes very irrelevant when people do their conditioning work. And that is a huge reason why people over train, get hurt, bur n out or any other term one would use for coming up short in their goals. For example, let's say that at your very best you can push the Prowler for 10, 40-yard sprints with 200 pounds in 15 minutes. The 50% rule would mean that your training would have you do the same work out in 20 minutes. Or you would do 125 pounds in 15 minutes. There are many different options that you can choose, and that is why it's a simple principle not an exact science. Your training should never be testing and by adhering to this rule, you can successfully train, recover and balance your training. If you take anything away from this section, let it be this principle. It has worked too damn well for too long to be a coincidence. Certain programs in this book are much harder than others and you must decide how much or how hard your conditioning should be. Your hard conditioning doesn't always have to be difficult; but understand that even an easy Prowler, sled or hill workout will be taxing. This is your personal responsibil ity. Your conditioning work must be in line with your goals, your program and your ab ili ties. If, at any point, your conditioning takes away from your lifting (or vice versa) or isn't inline with your goals, you should be making a change. THE PR OWLER There are a couple different variations of this sled, all of which seem to suck the same. The Prowler has its roots in football -anyone who has played the game can recognize the similarities to a push ing sled used during practice. It should come as no surprise that the Prowler was first developed with the help of the Clemson football's strength and conditioning staff many years ago. Besides being a great tool, there are a number of advantages of the Prowler: • Easy on the knees - even though you are push ing a weighted sled your stride length and impact is very low. • Easy on hamstrings - this is important for older people who cannot sprint or run without pull ing a hamstring.

THE PROWLER f 247 • Don't get sore - this is largely a concentric movement and though your legs might get tired, you won't get sore. • Impossible to fuck up the technique - ju st put your hands on it and push. If it doesn't move, lower the hips or reduce the weight. • Safe - unlike many other conditioning tools/ideas that I see used inappropriately by ignorant trainers, the Prowler is one of the few weighted conditioning tools that can be done without much fear of get ting hurt. Save perhaps the ankles and Achilles, you are not in danger of injuring your back, knees, legs or shoulders. This makes it ideal for a large variety of training populations. I'm not saying that everyone can or should use the Prowler. I'm saying that if it is used, it can be done without much worry. The big disadvantage to the Prowler is the price, but there are a numb er of different Prowler varia tions, some of which are reasonably priced. However, the fitness industry is known for taking a great idea and making a shitty reproduction. So make sure you purchase a Prowler or something similar from a reputable company. It's better that you save your money for a few months and buy something great rather than purchase something shitty today. "Buy nice, don't buy twice" - this should be your motto when purchasing training equip ment. The Prowler can be pushed on grass, turf, concrete or asphalt. This makes it impossible to prescribe exact workouts, as each of these su rfaces is different. If any of you have pushed your Prowler in high grass, you know exactly what I'm talking about. You can choose to run with the Prowler or walk - walking may seem easier in writing but I can assure you it's much worse. However, your body might not like running with the Prowler so choose the option that is best su ited for you. I talked about conditioning goals earlier, and it's imperative that if you use the Prowler, you have a goal to shoot for. Don't ju st push it to push it - and now that you are reading this book, you can no longer claim ignorance. For pu rposes of ill ustration, we will use the goals for my gym and show you how we can easily program the Prowler. The goal for the Prowler is 10, 40-yard sprin ts/walks done with your bodyweight, in 15 min  utes. Yes, the weight of the Prowler is included ju st like everyone does with the weight of a barbell. Now the kicker is this: not everyone's immediate goal is this. We have plenty of people that cannot even come close to this. In this case, we lower the goal and plan the training around that. Once we reach that goal, we once again change our training to reflect the new mission. It's all very easy. Goals in regards to the Prowler (and lifting) that are based on bodyweight favor the smaller person. So if you are over 240 pounds, understand that you may have to al.ter your goals. We have found that the best way to accomplish this goal is use the 50% method; so our training is always a little easier than the goal. There are an infinite number of variations you can use but here are the ones that I use: 10 x 40 yards with 70-75% of goal in 15 minutes 10 x 40 yards with 100% of goal in 20-22 minutes 8 x 40 yards with 110-12 5% of goal in 15 minutes

248 I 5/3/1 FOREVER The final option is one that I do for fun, and I can't emphasize enough how little fun this really is: 2 x 40 yards with 70-75% 2 x 40 yards with 100% 2 x 40 yards with the heaviest weight you can possibly move. This particular workout has no time limit, as the last set can be very hard and may take as much as 5 minutes to complete one of the final sets. These lasts sets can be as hard as you make it - but let me go on record that I have lost many a shoe trying to push an incredibly heavy Prowler. I don't recommend this last option to be done very often but it's a fun challenge to do on a weekend, once a month. If you are new to the Prowler, the first workout can be horrible - the first couple of trips aren't that bad and then it hits you. And it hits hard. So don't be in a rush to be a Prowler Al l-America n; start light and be smart about it. • Set your personal Prowler goal based on your cu rrent fitness level and the su rface on which you push the Prowler. • Make sure your Prowler training follows the 50% rule . • Test yourself dur ing the 7th Week protocol. Understand that if you are using the Prowler for conditioning it becomes unnecessary to do single leg work for assistance. THE SLED Onc e the darling of the strength world, the sled got pushed aside when the Prowler became the BMO C. However, the sled still has a lot of merit and should be treated as such. The sled has many of the same advantages as the Prowler with the difference being that the sled is much more cost efficient. Having used a sled since high school, I can say that the biggest mistake people use with a sled is attaching the strap to a weight belt. This is not only uncomfortable but it reduces the leg strength and the weight you can use. It's like wearing a condom when masturbating - totally use less. There are two options to use when pulling a sled. The first is wearing a harness. If anyone has used a sled for running sprints, you have worn a harness. If anyone has watched or done any strongman events in which the pull a truck, you have seen a harness. The harness makes pulling heavy weights much more comfortable, as you can lean into it and use leverage to pull. The problem is that a har ness can be expensive.

HI LLS, ST AIRS AND EVERY TH ING ELSE I 249 The second option is holding onto a sled strap - these are incredib ly inexpensive and allow you to use forward lean to handle heavier weights and actually use your legs and hips to move the sled. Plu s you can use the straps to pull the sled backward. Like the Prowler, we have goals for the sled. Again, these goals will vary greatly du e to the su rface you drag on and your cu rrent strength and fitness level. Sled Goal: Bodyweight x 10, 40-yard walks with bodyweight; 5 walks forward, 5 walks back ward, in 15 min utes. Alternate between backwards and forwards. If anyone has done heavy sled dragging backward, you will know that your quads start to bu rn, and it sucks. The best advice I can give you dur ing the test and training is this: keep the sled moving, even if it's just inches. Aga in, the sled is cou nted as part of the total weight. The conditioning test is best done when holding the sled straps, not using the harness. This allo ws you the ability to easily transition from backward to forwards. The same training ideas of the Prowler apply to sled. Just remember to repeat the mantra, "Training is not testing, training is not testing ... " Once again, if you are using the sled as conditioning work, cut out the single leg work as part of your assistance work. HILLS, ST AIRS AND EVER YTHING ELSE I love running hills. I used to love sprinting hill s, but now my fastest run can hardly be called a sprint anymore. I grew up outside of Chicago and Wa lter Payton was the standard for how you played the game of football. Payton became known for his ridiculous hill running workouts, and thus, this became the best way to get your legs and lungs strong for football. It's impossible to program hill sprints in any training program - no two hills are alike. With this in mind, let's use some common sense to how you would program and train hill work. First, and this is obvious, have a goal. Anyone who is serious about training has a goal. For example, let's say you want to be able to run 12 hill s in 20 minutes. Using the 50% rule, we can now mix and match different hill running workouts. It is really that simple. Now you can run hills, make progress and not screw up your lifting in the process. Running hills can be very hard on your ankles and Ach illes, so make sure you let your body adapt and you are prepping the problem areas prior to running. It has been my experience that no less than two hill sprint sessions should be done per week if you wish to make progress. The other days can be spent doing other conditioning that can help your hill running.

250 I 5/3/1 FORE VER Stair running is the snobby cousin to hills. Like hills, not everyone has access to them, and if they do, they vary greatly. Same basic rules apply: set a goal and use the 50% rule for your training. I have two great hills to run and between them is a set of about 80 stairs. Stairs are much easier on your body, espec ially the ankles. I have ran these quite a few times and have even used a light (5-10% of bodyweight) weight vest when running them. I can't really recommend it for those that don't have a long history of conditioning, hills, stairs and the weight vest. However, if you do fall into this category, it can be another chall enge and another goal. Being in good cardiovascu lar shape takes nothing more than the will and discipline to get it done. There are a plethora of different hard conditioning options - some of them are pretty good, some of them are so amazingly stupid that I can't bel ieve people would even try them. Whatever you choose, remember that what you do "on the field" will affect what you do in the weight room, and vice versa. If you are new to something, don't bl ow your gasket the first day: start light, get a feel for the exercise and then simply establish a goal. After that, stick with the 50% Rule and you'll be fine. RUNNIN' WITH THE DE VIL When Van Halen were on, they were amazing. Drop Dead Legs, Unchained, And the Cr adle Will Rock, Mean Street and the aforementioned in the title; all great Van Hal en songs. But man when they stunk it up, it was all eggs and onions. Runnin g is quite similar to the ups and downs of Van Halen. When used properly by those that can, it can be a great form of exercise. But in the hands of the ill equi pped and ill advised, it can be a huge disappoi ntment. Under stand that not everyone is buil t to run. If you are overweight, even if you aren't terribly fat, running isn't good for your knees. That doesn't mean you cannot run but the stakes are higher. Now if anyone grew up in the 80's and early 90's, running was synonymous with health. Everyone ran, or jogged or "yogged" according to a well-known news anchor. The streets were paved with the sweat and bad knees of every American. Eventually, like anything in the fitness world, it became the devi l. It made you fat, made you lose muscle, lowered your testosterone and made you a dirty liberal. All the things that make every American squi rm. The mere mention of "going out for a run" uni nvited your children to any play date. So the pendulum swung to the other side, with people completely ignoring the benefits of running. Some eschewed cardio altogether using pictures of marathon runners to prove their point: you run, you will look emaciated. This is no more true than showing a top class bodybui lder and letting the non-training world know that is what happens after one week of squatting with a barbell. (Note: your body type will generall y choose your sport, especially if you reach a highly competitive level. The old line of thinking that lifting weights will stunt your growth or make you blocky is a result of people looking at top-level strength athletes. The truth is many strength sports, bodybuil ding, Olym pic lift ing and powerlifting, favor a shorter athlete with favorable leverages. Again, lifting weights will not

RUNNIN ' WITH THE DEVIL I 251 stunt your growth. Not unless playing hoops will turn you into a tall, black man. This is basic common sense.) The bottom line is that running isn't bad for you, if done correctly. It can help you stay lean, get lean, get in great shape a�d help clear your head. I have done every form of conditioning over the past 30 years and nothing really compares to running. Yes, you can do other stuff, and it's cool to think a sledgehammer is conditioning, but running pretty much trumps everything. There is something great about running hard and what it does to your head. So don't belie ve the hype. Runnin g needs to be defined before we go into how to use it in your training program. Runnin g is not jogging. Jogging can best be defined as a bouncy walk. You see this a lot on subur ban and city streets. People are moving as fast or ju st a bit faster than they can walk. It really makes no sense unle ss you are doing this for a specific competition, and it can wreak havoc on your knees, ankles and feet. Running is not sprinting. Spri nting is going as fast as you can, trying to, to quote Spinal Tap, "break like the wind:' Athletes in ju st about every discipline use sprints to increase their speed and their conditioning; all depending on the protocols used. Spri nting (recently rebranded with the catchy title of High Intensity Interval Training (H.1.1.T.) which is nothing more than running wind sprints or gassers) is often favored in the fitness world, again using the physiques of sprinters to show what will happen to you if you lift your knees and push really hard. Sprinting for the majority of people is not a good idea, especially in an untrained person or someone who has no RECENT history of sprinting. Muscle strains, especially in the calves and hamstrings are inevitable. So let's can that idea and leave it for the competitive athletes who need it for their sports. Running is somewhere in between jogging and sprinting. I usually describe it as the pace you'd run to put out a fire on your least favorite family member. Not the one you hate, but the one who kind of sucks. Think about running as fast as you can. Now think about doing about 60-70% of that pace. In easier terms, jog harder with your knees up and be a real lazy sprinter. The goal of running, at least as far as the total training program for 5/3/1 is to run 1 mile without much of a problem. Or to put it blu ntly, drop your mil e run time to a level that is acceptable for you and your abili ties. There are always going to be standards set by people, but some people can't run a su b-6:00 mile. But a 9:00 mile should NO T be the end goal; it can be a goal at some point on the spectrum but maybe we should have some sort of drop off point. I think about it like this - every healthy ab le person should have the abi lity and capacity to run one mile. And when you consistently train to improve or maintain your mile run and combine that with a proper lifting and mobil ity/flexibility pro gram, you are, at the very least, in better shape than 99% of people in the world. It also means you are not horribly overweight - obviously it won't mean that you are ready for the next Mr. Olympia , but you can't run one mile hard with a du de fupa obscur ing your meat. How you should condition should largely be based on what position you would play on a football team. If you are a bigger guy and look like an offensive or defensive linemen, you don't need to be running long distances. Your conditioning should match your position: sled pulli ng/p ushing and doing aerobic work that doesn't stress your joi nts. Being 300 pounds and running often can do a lot of damage to your body. Now if you buil t more like a running back or linebacker, you can combine the sled work of the linemen and running. There should be a happy medium between the two. If you

252 I 5/3/1 FOREVER are smaller, much like a typical defensive back or wide receiver, you are better buil t to run. You can still use sleds but your body is more adept at handlin g more running volume than the other two posi tions. These are ju st general recommendations - even if you are skinny it doesn't mean you should run. There are a lot of skinny people out there that should stick to linemen conditioning protocols. So base your conditioning on how your body feels: you feel like a lineman trapped in a 1751bs body? Then heed your personal vision. For anyone that hasn't run in a long time, or at all, the first thing you will need is for your body to adapt to the stress. This is a huge factor in using running as part of your program. Just because you can ride the bike well or do the rower for record time doesn't mean you can run. This is because there needs to be a specific adaption to the exercise. In other words, if you want to be good at running, run. Nothing shows this point more than Lance Armstrong. At his peak, Armstrong was the figurehead of extreme condition ing. He could ride all day, up hills, past any competitor and made it look easy. When Armstrong ran some marathons, he didn't fair as well. He obviously did better than Oprah, but it wasn't what the majority of people expected. The reason is simple: his body hadn't been trained specifically for task of running. The mile run is one of the basic conditioning standards of the 5/3/1 program. But the best way to increase your mile time is not to always run a mile. Rather it is better trained with a variety of shorter distances and keeping your body strong with weight training. I recommend that anyone new to running use a total of 1600 meters per workout, three times a week for one full cycle of training. You will not run a mile outright. Instead you will run between 100-400m, several times, adding up to 16 00m. There are obviously different ways of doing this, and an infinite amount of possibil ities. Zx'fOOm 'fxZOOm 1x'f00m 'fxZOOm 'fx100m 16x100m BxZOOm If you are new to running, I recommend running three days/week. It's ok if you feel slow, awkward and like you are wearing Herman Munster boots; it will pass. As with any new conditioning or phys ical endeavor, I recommend trimming your training down until your body adapts to the new stress. Running seems to affect your strength levels more than any other conditioning endeavor - at first. Onc e your body adapts, you'll be fine. Milli ons of athletes have run, lifted and achieved great levels of strength. At the very least, if you are new to running I re commend doing two full cycles of one of the following: Orig inal 5/3/1 or 5's PRO 3-5x5 FSL, with 0-50 total reps of assistance in the three categories. Cut out the lower back work and the single leg work, too. The assistance work must be manageable and keep the jump s and throws to 10/workout. If you choose to increase the volume of the running per workout, simply increase the total distance done. You can increase to 2400m and then to 3200m (1.5 and 2 miles respectively) each time you run. Keep the distances between 100-400m. If you choose to do this, programming your training

EAS Y CONDI T IONING I 253 around this is very easy. During your Leader templates, keep the running to 160 0m, three times per week. As you progress to your Anchor templates, continue to run three days a week, only increasing the total amount that you run. The big mistake people make when they are trying to push their running is not accounting for it in their lifting, even when their bqdy adapts. Ridin g an Ai rDyne is fine when you do Boring But Big. But trying to improve your running and doing higher volume on squats is not a good thing; you have to choose. It has been my experience, along with thousands of other athletes and coaches, that con cessions have to be made. I remember reading that someone wanted to "train like a bodybuild er, run like a football player and be as strong as a powerlifter:' This may seem like great motivation or make a snappy t-shirt, but isn't it about time we are honest with ourselves? This doesn't mean you cannot run with some of the harder templates; what it means is that the running may have to be reduced and done with the minimal amount to maintain. The first one or two cycles, do not worry about the rest time between runs. Rest as much as you need to get the work done. After you've adapted to the running and are in better running shape, use a 3:1 rest/work ratio. What this means is if it takes you approximately 70 seconds to run 400 meters, rest 210 seconds before you run again. If you don't understand this, however long it took you to run, mul tiply this number by "3 " and that is how long you shou ld rest. This doesn't have to be exact, either. Ju st use it as a guidel ine. A 2:1 ratio can eventuall y be used, but it's not something that is essential. When you begin running, don't test your mile time before you beg in your training. Use the training to help adap t your body, especially your ankles, feet and knees. Test your mile the same week as the ]lh Week Protocol. EASY CON DITIONING Personally, I like calling easy conditioning "roadwork" - a term made popular by boxing. The general rule of roadwork is simple: this is conditioning that doesn't negatively affect your lifting. Depending on your age, experience, access and fitness level, roadwork can be any number of things; joggi ng, biking, walking, weight vest walking or any popular cardio equip ment. I bel ieve everyone should be doing some easy conditioning, regardl ess of your goals. It is especially important for six groups: • Older and/or more experienced lifters - great for heart health and recovery. • Anyone new to training - while strength is important, an aerobic base allows for better recovery and allows for greater fitness potential in the long run. • People carrying too much body fat (this is subjective but for males, anyone at or above 20% body fat) - diet is also very important but another important factor is stress on the joints is you are carrying too much body fat.

254 I 5/3/1 FOREVER • Those whose goals are solely lifting oriented (competitive lifters) - this allows total recovery for their goals. Remember that hard conditioning is/can be as stressful as a weight training work out. Don't sabotage your goals to adhere to a trend. • Anyone with a personal history or family history of heart or blood pressure problems - this is obvious. • Anyone who struggle s to finish prescribed weight training workouts - a good aerobic base allows for better work capacity. The general guideli nes for easy conditioning are three weekly sessions of 30-45 minutes. Aga in, what you choose is largely based on who you are and what you have access to. Personally, I bel ieve the best easy conditioning, regardless of level, is riding a bike. More specifically, I belie ve the Schwinn Ai rDyne bike to be far superior to any stationary bike. There are numerous activities you can do: running, swimming, biking and walking. Remember that even these done at a moderate pace will also require an adaption period, especially if you are new to it. For example, I can ride a bike and do a weight vest walk without any problem. Throw me in a pool and things are doing to be much different. But in general, the bike and a weight vest walk will be the least stressful to most people. It is in the nature of any hard training athlete to turn an aerobic activity into a competition. My best advice is to understand why you are doing what you are doing or simply wear a heart rate monitor. Your heart rate will largely be determined by your age. RECOV ERY Recovery is the last link in training. So much attention is paid to the training that few things are done in the name of recovery. And when they are addressed, it is usua lly a gimmick. John Mead ows had the best analogy in regards to recovery. Training is digging a hole; the longer and harder you train, the deeper the hole. Recovery is trying to fill the hole again, so that you are "level: ' For many, they may dig ten feet and only refill eight. So while it may not seem apparent from workout to workout, over time you dig yourself into such a deep hole, it becomes impossible to get out. A lot of people like to reference great athletes with insane training sched ules. They remark that if this person can handle that kind of training, you should be too. They do have a point. Most people who are training for something they truly love and would die for have a propensity to handle ins_ane amounts of work. They are driven to do whatever it takes. And really, many of us can handle more than we are currently doing. But using their training as blue prints, and not inspiration, is where things can go wrong. The reason these great athletes are being talked about is BECAUSE they are the exception not the rule.

REC OVERY I 255 The one athlete in America that embodies this spirit is Dan Gab le. Gab le was an Olym pic wrestler whose list of accompl ishments would fill this entire book. His most famous is winning gold in the 1972 Olympi cs, never surrendering a single point, while competing with a severely damage d knee and seven stitches in his head. Think on that for a moment. Gabl e's work ethic is one of legend. He trained all the time, rarely slept and his weight restrictions kept him from eating a lot of calories. If you think anyone trained hard, mu ltiply that by 100 and you might get close to Gable. I have been lucky to be acquainted with several people who knew him and the stories are legenda ry. Now let's all hold hands and repeat this mantra, "I am not Dan Ga ble:' There is only one and that's OK. I prefer people take the Neur osis method of divining inspiration for training. Neur osis is a heavy metal band that started and perfected (which is rare!) a different su b-genre of metal. No one ever sounded like them and with the hundreds of imitators out there, no one can match their sound. When they began playing over 30 years ago (as of this writing) they sat down and agreed on four bands they found inspirational: Black Sabba th, Ameb ix, Rudi mentary Peni and Black Flag. I may be missing one, but the point is they used these bands as inspiration, never trying to be a clone. And it took years to hone their sound. So with every great person whom you admire or whose training you love, it's fine to take inspiration. But never try to clone their exact training, especially once you mature and become your own person. You are you. You are not Dan Gable. Understand that for all these great athletes who train like madmen, what you see advertised is a snapshot of where they are today. Not where they began. To be able to handle that amount of work takes decades of building towards it. No one swims across the ocean without first swimming laps in a pool. So be wary of what you read and what you apply. Yes, there should always be standards of work and performance, things we shoul d all be able to do or handle. However, using the exceptions will do you no good. There are four major components of recovery: diet, sleep, movement and training. These are not sexy. These do not involve some secret Russian system of hooking up jump er cables to your testi cles. This does not mean there aren't other effective means. This means that until you take care of these four things don't bother looking at some fad that is being sold to you. REC:DVERY: TRAI NING The first rule of recovery is a simple one: don't train like an asshole. Your training must be in line with your current state of fitness, your cu rrent goals, your cu rrent lifestyle and be rooted in some common sense. The vast majority of people reading this have things going on in their life other than lifting. If you do not fall into this category, I suggest you find something to do. We all have jobs and families, many of us have families that we sup port and nurture. We have jobs that are stressful. We have other hobbies and interests. Training should n't be your life, it should be a part of your life that helps challenge, enhance

256 I 5/3/1 FORE VER and strengthen your mind and body. Wh ile a huge portion of my life is writing and coaching, my own training is totally separate. It needs to be in proportion to my life outside the weight room. Und erstand, the stresses of life, even if they are minute in the big picture of the world, are YO UR S. One of the biggest fallacies that I fell for years ago is known as "First World Proble ms:' This is what people like to remind others of when something isn't a huge deal. For example, a few years ago I had to do two MRl' s in the same day. I'm horribly claustrophobic, and I was given the option of being sedated dur ing the proced ure. I, of course, took that option. I wo_ke up ab out three hours later in immense pain. My ribs were bruised and I had huge welts and bur ns over my arms, stomach and hands, and I had a collapsed lung. It sucked, and I never got a good answer to what had happened (a lawsuit would have cost more money than I could afford despite me asking for nothing but the cost of the MR I to be covered). But the point is that I was told this was a First World Problem. See, I had the opportunity to get an MRI in a clean hospital with a competent staff and clean running water. After the MRI , I was driven home by my father. A father whom I've known my whole life and who has always loved me. No, this was not Hiroshima. This was not genocide. This was not cancer. The "First Wo rld Problem" myth is great for gathering perspective on your life. But to think that these things don't cause stress or don't matter in YO UR life is bull shit. This is the "dangling keys" technique. People dangle keys to distract a baby from what is really happening to them. People use "First Wo rld Problems" as a way to distract you from shit that needs to be taken care of and resolved. Someone always has it worse than you; we all get it. So understand that some problems in life can be resolved with perspective. Others are real and cause stress and have to be accou nted for in your training. You also must be honest about what you are willing to commit to in training. Everyone knows the famous quote from Mike Tyson, "Everyone has a plan until they get pu nched in the mouth:' A training plan is only as good as the effort, belief and commitment you actuall y give. You can draw up the most amazing training plan in the world, rife with squats and deadlifts and day after day of Prowler pushes. But unless you are willing to do the work, it's nothing but a dream on a piece of paper. And the more honest you are, the better your results will be. And consistency over time will lead to greater success - even if it's not perfect. Think about a friend, neighbor, work associate or family member that is 40 years old or older. The one that has let himself go and hasn't done anything for his body other than eat, drink and sit around. We all know someone like this. Now imagine if he did any smart, basic lifting program two times a week and did some kind of conditioning two days a week. As an example, on Monday did squats/ bench press and on Thursday he did deadl ift/press. Each day was followed by some bodyweight work (push- ups, di ps, sit-ups, chin-ups/pul l-up s and inverted rows). After each workout, he either rode the Ai rDyne for 30 minutes or pushed a Prowler for 20 minutes. Prior to each workout he per formed the Defranco's Ag ile 8. Now picture this person doing this training program since he was 18 years old. He made no changes to his life other than these two days. These two days he pushed his body hard and worked his ass off. Just two days a week. At 40 years old, he'd have 22 years of commitment and experience. The dif ference would be immense. Even if his diet wasn't perfect and he sat around the other days, he'd be a totally different person; physically and mentally. It would n't be perfect but you will never convince

RE COVERY I 257 me that a long-term commitment to a common sense program doesn't trump everything else. I've seen it first hand in older people; people who remain committed to working hard on their training for decades. They may not be squatting 700 pou nds, but their quali ty of life, metabolism and health are beyond their peers. This is a big picture scenario, but if you are honest about your commitment and then work hard atthat commitment, you will be light years ahead of your peers. Not training like an asshole also involves some common sense. If what you are doing is running you down and you are consistently tired, sore and getting weaker, change something. This is different than having a bad workout or even a bad week. This is chronic shittiness. "More is better" has been the new trend mantra. This is ignorance at its finest. "Better is better" is much more accu rate. And "better" might mean you need to be honest with yourself. This can be remedied by changing some thing as simple as main lifts, days/week you lift, the volume of the su pplemental and assistance work, your conditioning or your recovery work. You don't need to change all of these things at once; as with any long-term approach, it's best to change one thing at a time and monitor the results. This is not the time to panic or change everything. The final step of not training like an asshole is what I hope to accomplish with this book: having a plan. My goal is to put you in the best position, month after month, for success. I see too many people trying to run Boring But Big, First Set Last, PR sets, Joker sets, a ridicu lous amount of assistance work and then push the Prowler - all done four days/week. This may work for you, but only for a short time. A smart way to program for the long term is to mix/match each different portion of your training. A smart approach does not make you less hardcore. This doesn't mean you'll always make huge gains every week. This means you'll have a system of principles that al low you to make progress over a long period of time. For too long, training has been about burying yourself. I can't count the numb er of times people tell me, "Jim, I feel really good and strong. I was thinking about adding X to my training:' Training is SU PPOSED to make you feel strong; constantly trying to bury yourself is what I call self-sabotage. I'm hoping this is as benign as bel ieving that training involves total suffering; martyrs for the strong! At worst, this is an unconscious decision to constantly bask in a world of complain ts, afraid of success because the victim is now reviled as a hero in our society. It's a bit dramatic, but I can't find the answer why anyone is chang ing what works. If you won the lotto every week with the same numb ers, why would you change? Wh atever the case, success can be had if you use your plan and use your head. Belie ve in what you do. Be honest in your commitment. Be ruthless in that commitment. Work with what you have and what you are given; and never try to be anyone other than yourself. As said before, you are not Dan Gabl e. You are not Arnold. And this is a blessing because you get to define and conquer as YO U. All of this is important for recovery, as this is the mindset that allows you to persevere when things become difficu lt. RECOV ERY: DIET There is no area more sensitive in training/fitness than the subject of diet. You'll get less heated reac tions making fun of someone's wife or childr en than if you mock whatever diet god they genuflect for every day. And let's be honest, diets come into favor, lose their luster, and usua lly reappear 5-7 years

258 I 5/3/1 FOR EVER later under a different name. All you have to do is be part of this industry for 10 or more years and you can see how the same dogma is being packaged under a different name. It begins as frustrating and ends up being comical; all you can do is shake your head and smile. Now we all know every diet fails until it becomes a lifestyle and habit. Every diet fails for one reason; it becomes impossible to follow in the long term. So the two most important things of a diet are: 1 It stops being a diet and becomes a long-term habit. i! It is in line with your goals. So you have to be honest with yourself and what you are willing to do. Personally, I don't follow a specific diet plan; I have guideli nes that I follow and have found that as long as I'm 90% compliant with these gui deli nes, I am fine. Now each training cycle, you have to add ress what diet gu ideli nes/ru les you need to follow for you to reach your goals. This is actuall y pretty simple to do. The hard part is holding yourself accountable for each day. I sug gest you keep a log of the food you eat in your training journal. I am a big fan of keeping your training log in a notebook - keep the phones out of the weight room. (Note: the best training book you will ever read is your training log. This will tell you more about training than jus t about any book you read.) I didn't realize this but apparently it is impossible for people to make any progress in the weight room unless you text between (and sometimes du ring) sets and have a lifting app. It's true and god knows how strong Kaz would have been if he had access to a smart phone and app when he was at his prime. Makes you think. It is important that you physicallyw rite down what your goals are for each training cycle. They can be as detailed as you need them to be (for example, the amount of protein you need per day, how many meals you will eat, etc.) or as simple (for example, "I jus t want to eat 4 meals a day:'), Experience will determine how exact your goals are. If you have been very conscientious about your diet the past 5 years, you can make your goals very specific. However, if you are honest with yourself and know you suck at sticking to a diet plan, give yourself some time to develop simple habits. Don't go full Diet Nazi at the get go. You will fail. Give yourself simple gu idelines to follow. As you get more experienced you can get more detailed. Small steps, my son. In fact, for those that need to lose weight/fat, the first step should be as simple as NO T gaining weight. Learn how to not gain weight. Just imagine what habits you can learn from this simple lesson. And now think of how these simple lessons and habits can now carryover to the big picture. This is jus t another gem that seems to be lost amongst the diet crowd for the simple reason is that it isn't sexy. Or it doesn't promise you ready for a wedding in 2 weeks. The majority of people who suck at foll owing an eating plan are usuall y too damn confused as to what to do. These people can certainly be forgiven due to the amount of bull shit information out there meant to scare people. If you are plug ged into social media (and that's a whole topic that really needs to be discussed) and are in tune with the fitness industry, you are hit daily with some diet/ food scares that have all the credibili ty of the internet behind them. It's not a secret that the majority of stuff that you read in the media or from fitness professionals is meant to scare you. Depending on what you read, red meat can either give you cancer or cure cancer - it ju st depends on the news

RE C OVERY I 259 cycle. And it doesn't take a Rhodes scholar to figure out that every study can be interpreted in what ever way the writer wants to slant the story. And who the hell knows who funded the study and how accurate everything really is. Aaron Rogers once told the fans in Green Bay to R-E-L-A-X. I would like to do something similar to those of you that are confused about diet. Calm the Fuck Down. Everyone. Just take a goddamn break. Now, years ago I learned a pretty simple lesson about taking a bowel movement. If you spend 5-10 minutes and really clear your head and think, most issues can be resolved whilst pooping. With that in mind, let's all go to the proverbial bathroom together, ignore the rude sounds and just do some thinking. Diet, at least for those reading this, can be broken down into three things: protein, carbs and fruits/ vegetables. I don't include fat for one reason - you are either getting fats from your protein sources OR taking some kind of fat suppl ement (fish oil, krill oil, etc.) With that in mind, I am still baffled by those that think eating whole eggs and dark meat can somehow make you into a serial killer. These are good things, and your fat should be a consequence of the protein you eat on a dail y basis. The benefits of eating fat have long been establ ished - if you want healthy skin, nails, hair and to have a brain that works eat some animal fat. So each me al you eat should have all three - some protein, some carbs and some fruits and veg etables. Now how much of these things you eat will depend on your goals, how you feel and your performance. For those of you that are paralyzed by die t, let's start with some simple gui deline s. First, don't worry about how much protein, carbs or fat you eat, at least at first. Ju st focus on getting a serving of each of these three per meal. Now a serving for a regular person is usuall y about a fist sized portion. If you are looking to get stronger and add some muscle mass you should increase the size of each portion. For the sake of simplicity, let's use this scale to help you in your quest to get bigger and stronger. • Protein - 2 fist-sized portions. • Carbs -2 palm-filled portions. • Vegetables/Fruit - 2 fist-sized portions. Remember that if you are not eating whole eggs, red meat or dark chicken, add some fat to your meal with addin g some olive oil or some other kind of fat to your vegetables or meat. A tablespoon per meal will suffice. This is the starting point. From here, we can mix and match the size of each the protein, carbs and fruits/vegetables. The first example is increasing the protein and vegetables/fruit while decreas ing the carbs. Make sure you eat a little more fat if you choose this option so you can feel more full at each meal. • Protein - 3 fist-sized portions. • Carbs -1 palm-filled portion. • Vegetables/Fruit - 3 fist-sized portions.

260 I 5/ 3/1 FO RE VER The second example is a decrease in protein and an increase in carbs. And no, this is not heresy. Carbs can be protein sparing and in many cases, this is easier to eat for many people. The vegeta ble s/fruit remains the same. • Protein - 1 fist-sized portion. • Carbs - 3 palm-filled portions. • Vegetables/Frui t- 2 fist-sized portions. Again , don't worry about the calories right away. How I look at diet is a bit different than most people, but I think it makes a lot of sense. It's not about calories or how many grams of protein or fat. Rather it is about performance. That is the key. Now some people will say that looking only at performance will all ow people to eat and eat and only care about the numbers on the barbell. Of course, if your only performance guideline is the amount of weight you lift, it doesn't matter. However, I belie ve in a total training program, one that Include s flexibility/mobi lity, strength training and conditioning. And as long as you prioritize your conditioning and jus t don't "hit the treadmill for a brisk walk two times a week;' your die t must remain in check. Too many people pass off conditioning as if it's an afterthought or a "player to be named later:' If you want to be a stronger person, not ju st in the weight room, you gotta be ab le to move. So your diet is more than jus t about moving weight, it's about moving your body. Good luck doing that on a belly full of beer and wings. PROTEIN Nothing has gotten more public ity and love in the fitness. world than protein. Accord ing to Everyone in the Weight Room, protein makes you strong as bull and is as important as oxygen. To an extent, they are correct. The protein recommendations for a hard training athlete change every day, so it's impossible to really know what to write - I personally like to stay in front of the trends and make sure I fall into the correct clique. But there is enough anecdotal evidence to say that an athlete or lifter that is training very hard needs more protein than the average person. Of course, many of the recommendations that are being pushed as gospel are being pushed by supplemen t companies that sell various protein powders, all with special powers that are sure to make you into Superman. So what is the answer? I have no idea. People say that one gram per pound of bodyweight is a good start. I would say most people need a little less than that when getting it from whole food unless they are really push ing their bodies, day in and day out. In general, there is one I'd like for you to keep in mind when choosing what is right for you. First, the more protein you get from actual food sources, the better. Speaking from experience and talking with thousands of athletes and lifters that actuall y train hard, the protein from real food always trumps processed protein powder. I don't know if there is an actual ratio, so I'll jus t make something up: every gram of "real food protein" is dou ble the protein in pro cessed protein powder. The qua lity is better. The absorption is better. Less bloating. Less time on the toilet. You feel better. In other words, in every area it is better. Well, except convenience. And that is what sells people: easy and convenient. But easy and convenient doesn't always mean better. If you

RE COVERY I 261 are serious about putting on muscle, getting stronger and performing better, you will find a way to get the majority of your protein from whole food sou rces. Now this isn't me telling you to throw out all your protein powder - it has its place. Now people will always say that it's impossible to eat that much protein from whole food sources. I immed iately ignore these people because I find that these are the people who always find an excuse. It's not impossible. It's not even that hard. Being a P.O.W. is hard. Raising an autistic child is difficult. Eating some more steak and eggs? Real ly? In general, start with two fist-sized portion of protein per meal. Now if you feel you need more, eat more per meal. It's really that simple. The key is to first develop the habit of eating a good-sized por tion of protein at each meal. Once that is a habit, you can now adjust the amount of protein based on how you feel and your performance. You don't need to count the grams all the time, so don't get too caught in the numbers. Make the habit and then adjust. FRUITS AND VEGETABLES As for the fruit or vegetable, I generall y recommend eating a bowl of salad (with whatever you want added to it: tomatoes, carrots, onions, etc), 1-2 cups of mixed vegetables/broccoli or ju st eating a piece of fruit (apple, banana, peach). Most of us don't eat enough fruits and vegetables, so even if you eat 4 apples a day, it's better than eating nothing. Choose the fruits and vegetables you enjoy and can stomach. The main reasons people don't eat a lot of fruits and vegetables are either they didn't grow up with it bei ng a priority (addr ess this with your parents or your therapist) or they don't find the taste that appealing. So eat the fruits and vegetables you do enjoy. If they make you gassy and taste like garbage, don't eat them. There are plenty to choose from and you are bound to find some you enjoy. Ju st to be clear, I am not one of those militant diet zealots who claims fruit makes you fat. I have yet to see some 600-pou nd man getting pul led out of his house by a forklift su rrounded by apple cores and banana peels. CA RBS Carbs-once the prom queen of macronutrients that fueled great performances-ar e now the whip ping boy and everything that is wrong with every overweight person on the planet. Bla med for nearly every disease known to man, carbs have fallen from fame as fast as Tiger Woods and Mark McGwire. If you stay in the industry long enough you will notice the Nature Effect. Nature seeks bala nce. You push, it pushes back. All it wants is to stay normal. So anything that gets a huge push in one direction will eventually get pul led in the other. Aerobic training is much like carbs - people could n't get enough jogg ing. Marathoners were the epitome of being fit. Fast forward a decade or more and any aerobic training will not only kill your muscle but evidently age you prematurely. Spri nts, which were renamed High Intensity Interval Training or H.1.1.T to those who don't have the lungs to say all those words, became all the rage on how to bur n fat. Now, it seems that it's good to do a little bit of both. Who knew.

262 I 5/3/1 FORE VER Back to the cloven-hoofed carbs - as you can imagine, carbs aren't bad. You need them and any diet that restricts them (and this doesn't count a diet needed for a serious health reason) is something that few people can maintain. In other words, it is a diet, not a habit. The problem is that people lump in rice, oatmeal and potatoes in the same class as doug hnuts and trench fries. So when you pick your carb sou rce, be smart. Choose foods like the ones listed above and, again, use your hand as a measuring tool. Now if you feel like you are carrying a bit too much fat and your performance is going down, eat less carbs and more protein. If you need to gain some weight, add in some more carbs per meal. Or stop eating carbs after a certain point du ring the day. The point is don't be afraid of carbs as they will help you get stronger, think better and will not make you fat. Ju st don't be a moron about what you choose. Common sense goes a long way in decid ing what you eat. MEALS PER DAY You think carbs were a shit storm? Now we have to weed through how many meals you eat per day. Back in the day, 6 meals a day was the rallying cry for anyone that wanted to gain weight or lose weight. That was the magic number and for years it stood fast, never shook by any storm that challenged its throne. You'd swear it was being protected by God, Kaiser Soze or even the lllum anti (which may ju st be wishful thinking as I bel ieve the latter was clearly responsible for the FDA's mis guid ed food pyramid). The 6 meals per day challenged the old 3 meals per day that became part of the American cu lture. It made sense though. For people wanting to lose weight, they ate smal ler meals more often, never being hungry thus not binging at one or more of the three meals du ring the day. For those that wanted to gain weight, it offered more opportunities to shovel calories down their throat and never go hungry. It worked for those that did it and were able to pull it off. Now, at the time that I write this, the second round of Breakfast is Bad Gang aka Coffee con Criso has made its way into the fitness world. Rememb er how I told you all this stuff gets recycled? The Warrior Diet made some waves when I was in college in the mid to late 1990 's. Mus cle Medi a wrote about it and the creator (or at least the mouth) of that craze was Ori Hofmekler. It made a small splash and then disappeared. It has since made its way back under several different names all with promises of (choose whatever your goal is). As always, it has many different scientific stud ies to back up its claims. But so does every other diet. So that doesn't impress me at all. It's like having a huge penis that never gets hard. Big deal. I'd rather stab with a knife than drag with a sword. Anyway, this diet is all the rage because it's new and promises to cure everything in the world. The Paleo diet was the same way a few years ago, too-as was the Zone Diet and the Atkins Diet and the Med iterranean Diet and the Founding Fathers Diet (poi nts to whoever gets that reference!). The point is not whether all these diets work, because they can, for a while. But they only work for a lifetime if it's something you can maintain and make a habit. There is no one right answer to how many meals to eat per day. If someone tells you there is, avoid them because they are full of shit. The numb er of meals per day is going to depend entirely on what fits your schedule . Read that again. And again. I'm a realist with a lot of this stuff and realize that everyone reading this has a job or is in school or in school WITH a job. This cannot be ignored when

RE COVERY I 263 giving advice like this. Now this doesn't give everyone a free pass to use that as an excuse. But you have to be honest with your situation and what you·can pull off. In general (and remember this is only a starting point), I would recommend everyone try to eat four "main" meals per day. That means you eat protein, carbs and a fruit/vegetable. If you don't know where to start, begin with 4 meals per day. If your experience tells you that you need more or less, do it. But 4 meals a day can usually be pul led off by everyone. Breakfast can be accompl ished by getting up 15 min utes early. Lunch can be packed the night before. Dinners can be planned ahead of time. And the fourth meal can simply be leftovers from one of the dinners or something easy to prepare. It's not difficul t if you are committed. And really, we all know that this kind of commitment isn't asking for too much. In fact, I think we can all be honest with ou rselves and say that most of the small training commitments we are supp osed to make fall off way too easy. But it's these that can make the biggest difference, especially over time. Now that all the basics are covered, lets dial it all in. This is where you are going to tweak things to make the things work for you and your goals. If you need to gain weight, you can adjus t the diet by: • Eating more meals per day (but don't lower the portion size). • Eat more protein and carbs (or change just one of them). • Add in some kind of liquid meal once or twice per day (high calorie protein drink). • Adding an extra "big meal" sometime dur ing the day. For example, I used to eat my normal meals and then eat a large pizza every night. If you feel like you need to lose some fat: • Lower the carbs at each meal, but increase the protein. • Lower the portion sizes. • Stop eating carbs at a certain point du ring the day. Somehow 6pm has become the magic number, but this all depends on your day and when you wake up/go to sleep. WATER The final piece of the diet puzzle is water. The recommendations for water are as varied as protein. And again, there is no right answer. People in the industry usuall y use a gall on of water/day as a guidel ine. For many, this is going to require way too many bathroom breaks to live a productive life. A simple approach to water intake is using something similar to the weight gain strategy (if you are hungry, you are wrong): if you are thirsty, you are wrong. Personally, I suck at staying hydrated unless I'm disci plined about it. So my simple plan is to drink a bottle of water at each of my four meals and 2 bottles du ring my dail y training sessions. In general, that is about lOOo z of water a day. This falls short of the gallon/day recommendations, but I didn' t feel any difference when drinking more.

264 I 5/3/1 FOREVER The one thing that I will recommend for those of you who suck at drinking water is to make it a habit, but do so slowly and try not to drink too much prior to bedtime. A SIMPLE PLAN If you want an easier way of doing this, here's what I do. First, I eat 4 meals per day. I had to work like hell to eat this many due to my poor appetite, so don't give me any sob stories for those of you that have trouble eating. Once I got into the habit of that, I then made sure I eat around 50 grams of whole food protein per meal. This is very easy and once you get the hang of eyeballing food, you don't even need to read a label. 50 grams of whole food protein x 4 meals a day = 200. I do not count any protein that is found in my carb sources either. Most of my protein comes from whole eggs, red meat , chicken thighs and chic ken legs. Choose the protein sources that you enjoy and figure out how much you need per meal. I always eat the protein first. For the fruit or vegetable, I ju st choose whatever I want: appl es, bananas, berries, peaches, plu ms, salads or steamed mixed vegetables. This is the second thing I eat. For carbs, I mostly eat potatoes, pasta, rice and oatmeal. Rice is almost always my go-to carb source as it sits better with me and is easier to eat. I generally eat about 50-100 grams of carbs per meal. I always eat this last. Obviously the more protein and fruits/vegetables I eat, the less room I have for carbs. If you want to limit your carbs for whatever reason, this is the best way to do it. Fill up on more protein at each meal, eat the vegetables second and then fill in the rest with carbs. This simple strategy is al most a foolproof way of eating. Eating for performance isn't sexy or complicated. And the way I explain and use it doesn't require an app. But for 99% of the people out there, it'll work if you use common sense, your brain AND performance to make decisions. GET A BETTER BDDY IN 36 MONTHS! I'm not sure if the next statement has ever been said but it sure needs to: if you need to lose fat, it doesn't have to occur over 8 weeks. Or 12 weeks. The faster and quicker you lose the weight, the better chance you have of putting in back on, losing muscle and losing strength. Remember that most people took years and years to put this weight on. These are years to develop bad habits. Doesn't it make sense that it's going to take longer than 2 months to lose the weight? This isn't news. And this doesn't even require much thought. Yet the sheep continue to go through (and this is a sure sign of incompetence) crash diets (women) or cutting phases (boys). First, let's clear up who needs to "cut" and who doesn't. If your body is the human equivalent of a 36oz rib eye, it's ok to shed some fat. If you are a small, wilted carrot, save the cutting until you turn into an actual meal for a predator. If you are too fat for your own good, work on changing your habits. Work on changing your goals for training and conditioning. Develop long lasting eating habits that you can use for a lifetime. Let the

RE COVER Y I 265 weight come off as you work to do something great. Let it come off as a consequence of kicking ass and conquering physical performance goals. Turn the 275-pound squat to a 10-rep max. Buy a weight vest and do 3 miles every morning - see if you can log 25 miles a week with 100 pounds. Wo rk on hitting 10 strict pul l-up s. These are actions and goals you can be proud of. These are actions that can translate to confidence that can translate to self-esteem. Nothing can take the place of accompl ish ing a physical goal; you see it on the face of any man that has been out of work and comes home with a paycheck. He has earned that money to provide. That is action and that is reward. I don't understand any male that measures progress or self-esteem by using a scale and cal ipers. If that is your goal, go for it. But I was raised to do, to create and to achieve through action. Performance was what mattered. Competing. Working. Achieving. Don't look for the quick fix. Look for the right fix. All the great men on earth, the ones that are remem bered, have been men of action. They set goals, worked and accompl ished these goals. Then, they set new goals and worked harder and sometimes failed. But men of action do not give up and bitch and martyr themselves. They didn't fish for a pat on the back. They found a new way, a better way. HOW CLEAN MUST YOU EAT? There are a lot of nutrition/fitness experts who bel ieve every person has to eat the cleanest diet: no time for pizza, ice cream or even a piece of gum. Yes, I've heard gum as being a great deterrent for healthy eating. Every one of these Clean Eating Nazis has the same secret; somewhere bu ried in his/her closet is a shoebox full of pictures that document their former life as a Bel uga Whale. So because they can't handle sugar or a couple slices of pizza without falling into a deep hole of depression, whipping their backs and binge eating, no one can. So they present you with half-truths and cherry-picked data. How clean you have to eat is determined by your genetics and the sweat equity you've bu ilt up over the years. The former you have no control over - so deal with it and move on. SLEEP The next issue with recovery is sleep. Like diet, sleep is all about good habits: go to sleep and wake up at the same time. While this may sound impossible for many, especiall y those with kids, it can be done in a reasonable way. The key is simply giving you a window to do both - not exact times. You can do this by following a few simple rules: • Schedul e time to check email, phone, texts and browse the internet. Make it strict and don't waver. Bel ieve it or not, some of this stuff isn't life or death. Learn to get in, get out and then let it go. • Make a to-do list for tomorrow. This is especially important for those that go to sleep stressing about the next day. Write it down and let it out. This allows the stress to be transferred to the paper and out of your mind.

266 I 5/3/1 FOREVER • Be proactive during the day. Get your shit done. The above to-do list should be done as effi ciently as possible. Procrastinating will ruin you. • Read an actual book. I have three things that I do everyday: I write, I read a book and I do some kind of physical training. I never read about training before bed as this makes me think too much. Reading will not only relax you but will also put your mind at ease. Not to mention that you may actually learn something. There are many people who brag about how little sleep they need. It becomes a badge of honor for many. But the truth is that if you want to be healthy, want to be strong and you want to be productive in the time you are awake, you better get to bed. 8 hours/night is a general guidel ine. Obviously you may need more or less and this will change over the years and dur ing certain stressful parts of your life. REC DVERY: MDVEMENT I did n't know exactly where to put this part. While this has a lot to do with recovery, it can also be put in the mobil ity or conditioning sections of the book. As much as you and I like to compartmen talize training, there is a lot of crossover. And the closer you get to honing your skills in training and programming, the more you realize how things beg in to morph into one. It's either that or I'm high as shit right now. Shall we pick a little bit from column A and column B? In colle ge, we always did active recovery workouts after games; but playing/training for football is much more difficult than ju st lifting. So when I stopped playing football, I didn't really feel the need to do it. In the past year, I have reintroduced it to my training and am amazed at the results. I am rarely sore and able to train more often; also the quali ty of my workouts has improved. Notably, I don't need as much time warming up. While it can help a younger lifter, it is probably more important to the older lifter and the competitive athlete (no matter what the age). However, a few minutes a day for a younger lifter can certainly help. You may not think you need it and will not do it - that is fine with me. I would have been stubborn too. It's good to have this in your bag of tricks, especially later down the line when a squat workout leaves a five-day hangover. Active recovery is nothing new - people have been talking about it for years. The one problem that I had with it is too many people made active recovery into an actual workout, which seems cou nter productive to the process. I ask everyone to approach active recovery seriously but not to the point where it becomes a workout. To put it simply, do your active recovery with the same intensity as you would if you were getting ready for a reall y lazy fight. The number one rule of active recovery work is this: if it negatively affects your main training, you are doing it wrong. I generall y recommend doing some kind of active recovery on your non-weight training days. If you are doing hard conditioning on your off days, this would be done prior to the conditioning. Recovery work can also be done at night and done early in the morning. For those that train at night, an easy mobility session prior to bed and upon waking will do wonders. Active recovery can be as simple as performing the same warm-up/mobil ity routine you do prior to training. So this can be someth ing as simple as jumping rope for 250-500 jump s and doing

RE COVERY I 267 Defranco's Agile 8. For others, it can be much more involved. For those that need more active recov ery, I suggest you try some of the active recovery bel ow. ACTI VE REC OVERY N9l • Air Dyne x 3 minutes (easy pace). • Hur dle Duck-Linders x 5-10/side. • Leg Kicks (these can be done standing or on your back with a band) x 10/ leg. • Ab Wheel x 10. • Spide rmans - 10/le g. Done in a circuit; 3-5 times through. ACTI VE RECOV ERY N92 • Jump Rope x 100. • Turkish Get-up x 5/side. • Push-up s x 10. • Hurdle Duck-Linders x 5-10/side. Done in a circuit; 3-5 times through. AC TIVE REC OVERY N93 • Jog x 30-50 yards. • Spidermans - 10/le g. • Jog Backward - 30-50 yards. • Turkish Get-up x 5/si de. • Jog x 30-50 yards. • Push-ups x 10. Repeat 3-5 times. This is very similar to some of the stuff we did for recovery for football. So I'd like to thank Dan Wi rth for his inspiration.

268 I 5/3/1 FOREVER ACTIVE RECOVERY N94 This is perfect for people at home and with limited space. You don't need anything other than your bodyweight. • Drop into a squat position, hold for 5-10 seconds. Descend slowly and under control. • While in the squat position, put your hands on the ground and walk your hands in front of you, get into the push-up position. • Perform a spiderma n with each leg, holding each position for 5-10 seconds. • Return to push:-up position and do 1-3 push-ups, holding bottom position for 5-10 seconds. • Inch worm your hands back to your feet, keeping legs as straight as possible. Return to a stand ing position. This is done for 10-20 reps, each time through is one repetition. 99% of recovery problems can be cured by using smart programming that is applicable to your goals and your life and through good diet and sleep habits. That's it. It's not sexy. It's not marketable, but until you are consistent with these all the time, for years, you can stop looking for the next mira cle su pple ment or gimmick. I have never, ever seen anything work better. ACTI VE RE COVER Y FDR THE DLD&R AT HLETE This is something I have been doing for about a year, and it is not recommended for everyone. For younger lifters or more "fit" individua ls, this is not for you. However, if you have a long history of train ing and playing a competitive sport, and your body has paid a price, this might be for you. The spirit of this is easy to und erstand: You combine your conditioning work with your recovery work. But this requires a steady hand and competent mind. If you have a history of turning every training session into a testing session or don't know how to dial back the intensity, stop reading right now. This will only harm you. Generally, these sessions last about an hour and aren't meant to leave you gassed or needing more recovery. If you are lifting two or three days/week, this is perfect for you to do on your off days. For the conditioning, I use two general means: the weight vest and the Ai rDyne bike. The vest is never done with much more than 10-20% of my bodyweight. The Ai rDyne is generall y kept at a moderate pace, but this has more to do with the individual and the exact bike you have; too many variable s to program. But you should n't be sprinting.

ACTIVE RE COVERY FO R THE OLDER AT HL ETE I 269 Wh atever you choose, the idea is the same; walk or ride for a bit, stop and do mobil ity dril ls, then start moving again. I walk about 3-4 miles with the vest and stop 3-4 times and perform squats, spider mans, Cossack squats, hip flexor stretches, inch worms, arm and neck circles. These are not done for a huge amount of reps, rather they are done slowly and in total control. The big problem with this is you look like an idiot when you are out in public ; but I think we can all understand that no one really cares what you are doing. They are much too busy with their own lives to worry about what you are doing. At least, they should be. Busybodies need not be worried about. The bike is similar. You ride for 10-15 minutes, get off and perform two to three mobility movements. You get back on the bike and start again. The big reason I began doing this was that any walking or bike riding made me more stiff and sore than it should. The reason is simple: you get locked into one movement pattern for a long period of time. And for someone who has a training.and competitive history, this starts to become a problem. You need to move around a lot, in different ways and do so in a way that doesn't leave you too sore. Once again, you shouldn 't need to recover from your recovery. There are a lot of different things you can choose to do '- I've jogged and done this same basic setup. And I'm sure there are any number of things that people can choose to do. So choose whatever you want and ju st be sure to stop and do something that eases your stiffness. Let me make this very clear: if you choose to do this you won't be in shape to climb Mt. Everest, but your quali ty of life will improve. And you'll be in much better shape than you think. This al lows me to train as hard as I want in the weight room but still feel good and have a great qual ity of life. The other great thing is that I'm never sore anymore. Never. I push myself very hard on my lifts and do some really fun, stupid things but I don't wake up sore or limping. There is a price to be paid for putting your body and life on the line when you compete in sports. But you can g�t some of it back by being smart and still feed your competitive need in the weight room.
