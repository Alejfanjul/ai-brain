## Conteúdo

Hey, it's Seth Godin.

I've written a lot of books.

I started one of the first internet companies.

I've been a teacher for a very long time.

I built one of the first cohort based online learning institutions.

But I'm here today to talk to you about AI, which everyone wants to talk about, but not a lot of people

want to do something about it.

By way of background, I will begin with this.

I need to blame the triples.

The thing is, the Trouble With Tribbles episode of Star Trek was written by an author named David Gerrold,

and in 1972 he wrote a book.

It won tons of awards called When Harlie was one.

I was 12 years old.

I read it and my eyes opened up.

I've been living in an AI universe ever since.

I took a PhD level course with Doug Leonhardt at Stanford in 1983.

I worked with Isaac Asimov and Arthur C Clarke shortly after that, and I've been waiting for what we're

experiencing right now for a long time, waiting with some trepidation.

Not everything about what's happening all around us is great.

A lot of it is a really significant dislocation.

A lot of it is stressful, but it's also the biggest opportunity of our lifetimes.

I know a lot of smart people, and what I'm finding is that many of them are afraid.

They are not spending time exploring the tools that are out there.

They're hoping that everything is going to go back to normal.

It's very easy to come to the conclusion that the change we are facing is fraught, and particularly

if you're not 20 years old, it's a little bit scary.

So there are some basic principles that I want to share in this online course.

Not to teach you the ins and the outs, not to talk about the tactics that will make you money or happier

tomorrow, but to change your mindset.

Because if your mindset shifts, everything will shift.

The truth is that when the internet first arrived, I had my first email address in 1976.

But when the internet first arrived, almost nobody said, you know what?

I'm going to start.

I'm going to start a company that's going to become the biggest retailer in the world.

I'm going to start with books.

And nobody said, you know what I'm going to do?

I'm going to quit my job and drive for Lyft.

Even if parts of it are grueling, I want the freedom.

And nobody said, I'm going to build a video conferencing company, and nobody said, I'm going to build

an institution that lets people take courses like this one.

What people said was, oh, I can send an email to somebody else.

Isn't that clever?

It's just like stamps, but faster and free.

Seeing what the internet could and would do was reserved for a few people who, for whatever reason,

were less brainwashed than the rest of us.

In this moment, the indoctrination of school, the system, the way the industrial complex has pushed

us to be willing cogs in a thoughtless machine is encouraging people, even especially successful people,

to look at AI as some sort of curiosity, some sort of temporary hype, as something that isn't going

to be the biggest shift of our lifetimes.
