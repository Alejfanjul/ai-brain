Kind: captions Language: en Hey, what's [snorts] up? So, I just saw a post from Simon Willis talking about great example of a skill here, adding the ability to generate images using Nano Banana. So, if you go into this thing, Claude doesn't do image generation except it does just add a skill that connects Nano Banana Pro to your workspace. So, I just got done doing tons of work on this and I want to show you what I've done so far. I basically built a skill that does this, but it does it in a very specific way. It takes any content and it deeply understands the content and then it translates essentially my aesthetic of what I like for art and combines the concept of the input with the aesthetic that I actually want to see. Right? So my my brand for unsupervised learning which is like a modified like Tokyo night type of vibe. And so I want to show you what this looks like. So this is one of the images. Look at this. So this one is about why I think VCs are in trouble right now. And it's basically because before there used to be a gatekeeper and if you wanted to build anything, people had to come to the VCs because they had the money. And the little short article, this is just a few bullets here, basically says, "You don't have to do that anymore. You could just build stuff." And look what Kai made for me. Kai is my digital assistant who like built this for me. And look, he even signs each image, right? Even signs each image. This is insane. But anyway, look what he wrote. So, keeping with my theme, look, he's got some going into the funnel, but most of the workflow goes around the funnel. It followed the actual concepts. Okay, here's another one. Our constraints on creativity, a list of different ways we limit ourselves creatively. Look at this. You got a perfect application of my Tokyo night theme and the creativity of like how the art looks and the line length and like the line strength and how much cartoony it looks and everything. All of that is all defined in the thing I'm about to show you. And look, he signed this one as well. And it's cutting those barriers. It's cutting those ropes that are holding us back. Here's another one. Leave the EM dash alone. I just published this one. It's basically saying I I've been using a bunch of EM dashes forever. Actually, like 4,000 of them, evidently since I started writing in like 99. And look at this. I actually stole this concept. I want to mention I stole this concept. I saw this concept from a Wall Street Journal article that was the same. So I basically said, "Hey, look. It's a human hand and a robot hand, and they're fighting over an EM dash." So this is what Kai made for me. He didn't sign this one because I hadn't added that yet. And this is like my favorite one. Look at this. So, this post is about humans needing entropy, which came from a thing that Carpathy was talking about when he was on the Doresh podcast. He basically said that humans and models both collapse. And as you get older, you start to repeat the same things. You don't have as much diversity in your thoughts and ideas. And essentially, you need to add entropy. So, that's what this post is about. And it goes through it and also what the solution is. Look what Kai made for me. Look at this image. This is just ridiculous. It's a full diagram, right? That breaks the whole thing down and it's got like this excalad draw like style and kaisai in this one. Just absolutely insane. I also just made this was like half an hour ago or whatever. I made this where it's my Twitter header now. So you got human 1.0. We're slightly improving. We got this big crash because the AI impact and then hopefully we're going to human 3.0 and it arcs up. So I just described that with dictation using whisper flow which is what I use and boom made this completely different art style and I told it actually it was for a Twitter header which means it made the long one because it knew what that was. Crazy. So what I want to do is basically show you I want to show you what this code looks like. Okay so inside of the art skill that I have that's the way I've done this. I've created an art skill that does this. This is a custom routing thing that I have up here. So basically all my routing happens inside the system prompt. and then here are the 14 different workflows. These are all the different ways. Okay, so what I had Kai do was go and study the the release of anro 3 and then study the release and then come back with all the different things that it can do and turn those into individual workflows. This is the other thing that I do that's custom beyond cloud code is I have a workflows directory inside of every skill. So if I do here and I go KSC which is the core skill and I do tree you see I've got workflows and each one of these workflows is actually the things that you can run and those are in the header location right the front matter the system prompt section which has the routing right so when you call it the skill looks to see what all it can do by having that routing routing in the system prompt and what's cool about this is that cloud code loads those things by default. So you have full routing and I've got 50 skills or something and I don't have to do manual context management to handle that. Anyway, all that to say that this is what a skill looks like in particular this one the art skill and so it's completely crazy. So this is the description of the workflows um all the different things you could do with the workflows which are routed to from the system prompt and that's essentially what that looks like. Now what this calls on which I'm going to show you now is it calls on this right here. This is like step two. Step one is understand our art aesthetic, which I'll show you later or we'll talk about that later. But your art aesthetic is just like your look and feel, like your color scheme, your style, like all that stuff. So that's step one is look at the aesthetic. I probably have that in here somewhere. No, that's that's in this one. Yeah, see there under core aesthetic. But that's what it does first. But the second piece it does is it takes the content itself and it runs it through this other skill which is create story explanation or in this case it's called story explanation. And what this does is it does this big analysis of the concepts in the file and it breaks it down in a very simple way that like explains it like ELI5 or whatever explains it in very clear language like Paul Graham or like Richard Feman or something right so doesn't matter how complex the concept is it could be an entire book and it breaks it into 24 sections describing it perfectly that becomes what you compose the composition with that is then given to the art prompt to turn it into a composition completely crazy So, if we go and look back here, let's see. Here's an example. Okay, so I actually want to run this for you. I actually want to run this for you and show you. Here's an example of one I haven't done yet. This is like an old piece of art. Actually, it was an old attempt to do this before Nano Banana 3 came out. I don't like this art piece. You see what I was going for? I was trying to do some sort of aesthetic thing. But what I want to do now is I want to go back and I want to say &gt;&gt; Kai here, ready to go. &gt;&gt; What was the name of that thing? AI has an opposite data problem. Okay, I have a blog post called AI has the opposite data problem and I want to run the art skill and create a custom header image for that and we will see what this thing does. All right, art skill is running. Is it running on the right thing though? That's the question. We are now finding the blog post. It found the blog post. Reading the blog post. Dory explanation skill is now running. Found the blog post is now running through. Look at this. I've also got a be creative skill, which is basically increasing entropy on this thing. Boom. Look at that. It just broke down the concept into 24 pieces. Now, it's going to create a composition based on that full narrative arc. Okay, what do we got here? Black primary color, deep purple, visible visible accent. Looks right. Sign Kai as a tiny artist signature and charcoal bottom right corner. Okay, now this is cool. So, check this out. It's now executing a command line tool. So, I've moved to basically doing everything with CLI tools. And now it is saving. And oh my goodness, here it is over here. Whoa. Look at this thing. Oh my goodness. That is such a good capture of the concept. Look at all that data it needs to find. You can't tell because it's transparent. How is it transparent, by the way? Oh my goodness. Watch this. cuz it's using this as an API. It's using this as an API and that's how it's actually becoming transparent. All right. So, this is what it looked like before if you remember. And this is what it looks like now. This is the one it actually came back with. Absolutely insane. So, there's this one. There's this one. There's this one. There's this one. There's this one. Look how it's following the same theme. It's following the actual aesthetic. It's This is my new art style for the entire blog. I can go back to all these different posts and I could actually swap out the generic art that I made or the generic midjourney that I did starting in late 22 or whenever that was. And it's now I can make customized art. Kai can make customized art, right? Using this skill. It's absolutely insane. And because of those workflows that I showed you, it's not just this kind of artistic art, right? Like artsy art. It's also workflow diagrams. I could do mermaid diagrams. I could do comic strips. I could do anything. All because of the power of that Nano Banana Pro, right? The version three. It's just absolutely insane. And all built into a skill which calls another skill. And that brings me to the coolest part. Guess what? All the stuff that I just showed you, I'm not just going to talk about it and then leave you hanging. We have a repo here. We have a repo. It's this PI repo right here is where I put everything that I talk about. Not everything, most everything. This stuff that I just did was sensitive. I'm like, "Okay, do I really want to share?" Because this is ungodly powerful, right? Guess what? I did. I did share it. So, if you go into this thing and you go into, let's see, let's just go into the code and we go into Claude and we go into skills. Look at this. We've got the art system here. We've got the workflows that I just talked about to make all of these. And the thing that it requires is the other skill which is story explanation. And it's here as well, the full skill. You can now just go and make these things and basically come up with your own aesthetic because I published into here. The aesthetic I published is actually under the core skill. And if we look for the aesthetic, I've got one based on Tron and uh anthropic. I think their art style is cool. So there's like anthropicy a little bit, a little Trrony or whatever. Something that you know, it's not really copying anybody because Tron's been around for a very long time. But I just want to show you this structure. So you can now give your own AI, hey, I like this style. I like greens and teals or whatever and more artsy or less artsy, more technical, more, I don't know, infographic or whatever it is. Whatever you want to put into your style, you put into this aesthetic file. And then when you go to create art using the art skill, the first thing it checks is this right here. All right. So, I hope this helps. I hope you can see what I'm talking about, how powerful this is, and you can actually just go get the skill and do it yourself. And now I'm going to go back to Simon. I'm going to reply and post some of the stuff up there. And we'll see you in the next one.
