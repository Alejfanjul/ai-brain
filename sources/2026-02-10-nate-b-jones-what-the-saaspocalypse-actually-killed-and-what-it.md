Here's what actually died, what didn't, and what you should do about it.  ---[Nate](https://substack.com/@natesnewsletter)  --- Feb 10  --- ∙ Paid  --- A markdown file — not a product, not a platform — a markdown file catalyzed a ~$285 billion single-session collapse across software, financial services, and alternative asset managers.  On January 30th, Anthropic released a set of plugins for Claude Cowork, its desktop AI tool. One of them handled legal contract review. It could triage NDAs, flag non-standard clauses against a negotiation playbook, and generate compliance summaries — the kind of work that, until last week, required a paralegal, a Westlaw subscription, and billable hours.  The plugin was open-source. Anyone could read it. And when people did, they found roughly 200 lines of structured markdown prompts — first-year law school content dressed up with some clever workflow logic. It shipped with a disclaimer: “All outputs should be reviewed by licensed attorneys.”  By the close on Monday, Thomson Reuters had posted its biggest single-day stock decline on record — down nearly 18%. RELX, the parent company of LexisNexis, fell roughly 14%. Wolters Kluwer dropped about 13%. LegalZoom cratered nearly 20%. FactSet lost more than 10%. Morningstar fell 9%. The Goldman Sachs U.S. software basket posted its worst session since the April tariff selloff. The selling spread to alternative asset managers and private equity firms across the board.  The catalyst wasn’t just the plugin. Software companies were already posting disappointing earnings — missing revenue estimates at rates not seen since the post-COVID correction — and the broader “AI disruption” repricing had been building for months. But the Anthropic release crystallized the fear into a single, legible image: a text file doing work that billion-dollar companies charge per-seat fees to access. The logic was brutally simple: if AI compresses the cost of legal and financial analysis, then every firm charging premium fees for that analysis has a margin problem. Not next year. **Now.**  Jeffrey Favuzza on the Jefferies equity trading desk gave it a name. “We call it the SaaSpocalypse,” he told Bloomberg. “Trading is very much ‘get me out’ style selling.”  Here’s what almost nobody is saying clearly enough: the markdown file didn’t cause this. It revealed it. The per-seat SaaS licensing model — the financial bedrock that the entire enterprise software economy has been built on for twenty years — was already cracking. The market just hadn’t priced it in yet.  **Here’s what’s inside:**   * **The crash wasn’t about Claude.** What actually broke, why the “Anthropic killed SaaS” narrative misses the structural story, and what the sell-off tells you about where enterprise software is headed. * **The counterargument Jensen Huang is making — and the part he’s getting wrong.** Why defending the product doesn’t save the pricing model, and what print media should have taught us. * **The KPMG signal.** A quieter story that matters more than any stock chart — how the Big Four are already using AI as fee negotiation leverage, and why the cascade is just starting. * **What actually died (and what didn’t).** The data edge and the accountability edge are real. The per-seat model sitting on top of them is not. What that means for incumbents, buyers, and builders. * **The articulation problem.** Why “build your own” isn’t as simple as the hype suggests, what the real bottleneck is, and how much time the incumbents actually have. * **Why this is fractal.** The same bolt-on vs. rebuild dynamic that’s threatening SaaS companies applies to every knowledge worker reading this — and the window is narrowing.   Let me show you what the SaaSpocalypse actually revealed — and what it means for how you work.  Subscribers get all posts like these!     Grab the Prompts These prompts help you run the same repricing exercise on yourself — your role, your workflows, your vendor contracts. The Role Repricing Map borrows the article's framework directly: find your data edge, find your wringable neck, figure out which parts of your week are per-seat work that's about to get compressed. The KPMG Playbook gives you the actual negotiation script — talking points, counterargument responses, follow-up email — for the vendor call you should already be making. And the Bolt-On Detector exists because I've watched too many people add ChatGPT to their existing process and call it transformation. It isn't. These prompts force you to be honest about where you actually stand. **The Crash Wasn’t About Claude** Let’s be precise about what actually happened, because the narrative has already calcified into “Anthropic crashed the software market” and that framing, while useful for headlines, misses the structural story underneath.  What Anthropic actually shipped was a set of open-source starter plugins — templates that companies could customize for their own workflows. The legal plugin was one of several, spanning sales, marketing, data analysis, and other functions. It was competent but not revolutionary. Any decent prompt engineer could have assembled something comparable in an afternoon. Morgan Stanley analysts including Toni Kaplan acknowledged it “adds to investors’ fear that AI-native companies will be able to break into the legal tech space,” but were careful to note it was a demonstration, not a product.  So why did it move $285 billion?  Because the plugin made visible what the market had been quietly worrying about for months: if a text file can approximate the core workflow of a $60-billion-revenue legal information industry, the pricing model that industry is built on has a structural problem. Not a competitive problem. Not a “better product” problem. A structural problem — the kind that doesn’t get solved by shipping faster or hiring better salespeople.  Thomson Reuters charges per seat. LexisNexis charges per seat. Westlaw charges per seat. The entire enterprise software economy — from Salesforce to ServiceNow to Adobe — runs on a model that says: every human who touches this tool pays a license fee. That’s how these companies make money. That’s how they forecast revenue. That’s how Wall Street values them.  That model works when humans are the bottleneck. It breaks when AI agents can do the work without logging in.  The signals were already everywhere if you knew where to look. The software industry’s average forward price-to-earnings ratio had been compressing for months. Per Forbes contributor Don Muir’s analysis, the sector moved from roughly 39x to 21x over the preceding months — the steepest valuation compression since the 2002 dot-com bust. Earnings season was already ugly: software companies were missing revenue estimates at rates not seen since the post-COVID correction, while broader tech continued to beat. The per-seat model was under pressure before Anthropic shipped anything.  The Claude plugin didn’t start the fire. It showed everyone the building was already burning. **The Obvious Counterargument (And Why It Misses the Point)** Plenty of smart people think the sell-off was an overreaction. They might be right — about the sell-off. They’re wrong about what it means.  Jensen Huang, speaking at the Cisco AI Summit days before the crash, offered the strongest version of the counterargument: “This notion that the software industry is in decline and being replaced by AI is the most illogical thing in the world, and time will prove itself.” Gartner’s own analysts called predictions of SaaS death “premature.” JPMorgan Chase published a note arguing the software sector was being “sentenced before trial.”  Huang’s argument is simple: AI doesn’t replace software. AI runs on software. The more AI agents you deploy, the more software infrastructure you need — more databases, more APIs, more middleware, more security, more monitoring. Every AI agent that replaces a paralegal still needs Westlaw’s data — and a CRM, and document management, and security monitoring on top of all of it. If anything, AI increases the total amount of software the economy uses.  He’s not wrong. He’s also not making the argument he thinks he’s making.  Nobody serious is arguing that the world needs less software. The argument is that the world no longer needs to pay for software the way it currently pays for software. Huang is defending the product. The market is attacking the pricing model. Those are different things, and confusing them is how incumbents lose transitions they should have survived.  Print media made this mistake. Newspapers had content people wanted. They had local information, investigative journalism, sports scores, weather. The internet didn’t make that content worthless. What the internet did was destroy the access model — the idea that you had to buy the whole newspaper to get the one section you cared about, and that advertisers would pay premium rates to reach readers who had no alternative. The content survived. The business model didn’t.  Favuzza reached for this analogy: “The draconian view is that software will be the next print media or department stores, in terms of their prospects.”  He’s closer than Huang, but even this framing is wrong in an important way. Print media’s content did eventually get commoditized — anyone can publish now. Software’s content — proprietary databases, structured workflows, decades of accumulated enterprise data — hasn’t been commoditized and won’t be. Thomson Reuters’ case law database isn’t something a startup replicates over a weekend. Salesforce’s customer relationship data is irreplaceable. Adobe’s creative tool ecosystem has deep moats.  The data is safe. The per-seat access model for that data is not. And the companies whose entire financial identity is built around per-seat licensing are about to face the hardest strategic question in enterprise software: how do you reprice your most valuable assets without destroying your revenue in the transition? **The Paradox in the Panic** Bank of America’s Vivek Arya published the most revealing analysis of the crash. He called the sell-off “internally inconsistent” — and he was right, in a way that tells you something important about where the market’s head is at.  Investors were simultaneously running two theses. Thesis one: AI infrastructure spending is unsustainable and the capex boom will collapse. Thesis two: AI adoption will be so powerful that it renders established software business models obsolete. Both cannot be true. If AI is powerful enough to crash $285 billion in software market cap, the infrastructure required to run that AI is underbuilt, not overbuilt. The SaaSpocalypse is, paradoxically, the strongest possible demand signal for continued AI infrastructure investment.  And yet both trades were profitable — in different hands, at different moments. The DeepSeek selloff punished Nvidia. The SaaS correction punished Salesforce. Wall Street doesn’t resolve logical contradictions. It rotates between them. One week the market prices in an AI winter; the next it prices in an AI revolution so total that legacy software can’t survive it. The contradiction persists because no single firm needs to hold both positions. The market as a whole holds them, and the market as a whole has no obligation to be coherent.  That incoherence is the real story. Not the crash. **The incoherence.** **The KPMG Signal** While everyone was watching Thomson Reuters’ stock price, a quieter story broke that tells you more about where this is heading than any stock chart.  KPMG — one of the Big Four accounting firms — pressured Grant Thornton UK, its own auditor, to cut audit fees. The demand: pass on cost savings from AI. Grant Thornton initially resisted, arguing that “high-quality audits rely heavily on expert human judgment” and that fees reflect “the cost of people plus technology support.” KPMG’s response, per the Financial Times: lower your prices or we’ll find a new auditor.  Grant Thornton blinked. KPMG International’s audit fees dropped from $416,000 in 2024 to $357,000 in 2025. That’s a 14% reduction.  This story matters more than Thomson Reuters’ stock price, and I want to explain why.  The SaaSpocalypse was a market event — traders repricing stocks based on a changed view of the future. The KPMG negotiation is an operating event — a real company using AI as a lever in a real business negotiation to extract a real price reduction from a real counterparty. The stock market repricing might reverse. The KPMG precedent won’t.  Think about what KPMG actually did. They didn’t automate their audit. They didn’t replace Grant Thornton with an AI. They used the existence of AI — the fact that everyone now knows these tasks can be done more cheaply — as a negotiating weapon. The threat isn’t “we’ll replace you with AI.” The threat is “we both know AI changes the economics, so your old prices aren’t justified anymore.”  That’s a playbook. And it works in every knowledge-work fee negotiation.  If audit fees get renegotiated on the basis of AI cost savings, legal fees are next. Then consulting fees. Then implementation fees. Then design fees. Then every form of professional services billing that currently scales with the number of humans touching the work. The cascade doesn’t require anyone to actually deploy AI at scale. It just requires buyers to point at the SaaSpocalypse and say: we both know the world changed, so let’s talk about your rates.  The Big Four aren’t waiting for AI to slowly reshape their industry. They’re using AI as a lever today — not to automate their own work, but to negotiate down the cost of services they buy from everyone else. That’s the mechanism. Not stock prices. Not markdown files. Fee negotiation leverage spreading through the professional services economy like a crack through ice. **What Actually Died (And What Didn’t)** Let me be precise about this, because getting it wrong leads you to very different conclusions about what happens next.  The software didn’t die. The data systems underneath enterprise software — Thomson Reuters’ case law databases, Salesforce’s customer graphs, SAP’s resource planning logic, Adobe’s creative workflow ecosystem — represent decades of accumulated, structured, proprietary information that no markdown file comes close to replacing. Those data systems will continue to exist. They have to. The economy runs on them.  And there’s a second edge that the market panic completely overlooked: the single wringable neck. Enterprises don’t buy Salesforce because it’s the best possible CRM. They buy Salesforce because when something goes wrong at 2 AM on the night before a board meeting, there’s a phone number to call and a contract that says someone is accountable. That accountability layer — the vendor relationship, the SLA, the legal liability, the professional services team that shows up when the system breaks — is enormously valuable to large organizations, and no amount of agentic AI eliminates the need for it. If anything, the complexity of AI-driven workflows makes that accountability more important, not less.  So the data edge is real. The accountability edge is real. What died is the pricing model that sits on top of both — the idea that you charge every human who touches the software a per-seat license fee, and that your revenue scales linearly with headcount.  If one AI agent can do the research that previously required ten paralegals with ten Westlaw logins, Thomson Reuters doesn’t lose the value of their data. They lose nine seats of revenue. The data becomes more important in an AI-driven world — it’s the fuel the agents run on. But the per-seat access model that monetized that data for twenty years is broken, and the companies whose entire financial identity is built around it are the ones in the deepest trouble. Not because their products are bad. Because their business model doesn’t match the world anymore.  Here’s what the investor thesis actually comes down to: the markdown file represents an existential threat if and only if these SaaS companies run business as usual. If they just bolt AI features on top of their existing one-size-fits-all UI — add a chatbot here, an auto-summarize button there, call it “AI-powered” in the press release — they’re dead. The market is right to reprice them. The bolt-on approach doesn’t solve the structural problem. It decorates it.  The survival path is fundamentally different, and it’s the one Thomson Reuters is attempting with CoCounsel: pivot from a one-size-fits-all interface that humans navigate to an agentic-first architecture that AI agents navigate, and charge for the value of the data and the accountability rather than the number of humans logging in. That’s not a feature update. That’s a rebuild of the product, the pricing, and the go-to-market — simultaneously — while your stock price is cratering and your customers are on the phone asking for discounts.  Whether the incumbents can actually pull that off is the $285 billion question. They have the data edge and the wringable-neck edge, and those are real. But pivoting from UI-first to agentic-first is the kind of architectural transformation that kills companies that attempt it too slowly, and the clock is running at a speed that nobody in enterprise software has ever experienced. **The Opportunity Cost Nobody Is Talking About** There’s a second angle to this that most SaaSpocalypse analysis completely misses, and it might matter more than the pricing model question.  Think about what enterprise software companies actually spend their money on. Engineering. Thousands of developers maintaining, updating, debugging, and extending one-size-fits-all platforms designed to serve every possible customer configuration. That’s the real cost of enterprise SaaS — not the servers, not the sales team, but the army of engineers keeping a general-purpose system alive for millions of users who each use it slightly differently.  Now think about the opportunity cost. Every developer maintaining a legacy SaaS UI is a developer not building custom agentic workflows. Every sprint spent adding features to a one-size-fits-all product is a sprint not spent rethinking the product for an agentic-first world. The companies that crashed this week aren’t just facing a pricing model crisis. They’re facing a resource allocation crisis. Their most valuable people are maintaining the old thing when they should be building the new thing, and the transition requires doing both simultaneously with the same budget.  This is where agentic software engineering changes the math in a way that most people haven’t fully internalized. The cost of building software is falling toward zero. Not slowly. Not theoretically. Right now. Cursor shipped a system that generates 1,000 code commits per hour with no human involvement. StrongDM published a production framework where “code must not be written by humans and code must not be reviewed by humans.” An OpenAI researcher, Karel D’Oosterlinck, wrote that he spent $10,000 on Codex tokens and automated his entire research workflow. These aren’t demos. These are operational systems running in production.  When building software costs approach zero, the economics of “buy versus build” flip for the first time in decades. The entire enterprise SaaS value proposition was predicated on the idea that it’s cheaper to buy a general-purpose tool than to build a custom one. That was true when software engineering was expensive and slow. When an AI agent can build a custom CRM in an afternoon for the cost of an API call, the calculus reverses. Why pay Salesforce per-seat fees for a tool designed to serve every company on Earth when you could have a tool designed to serve your company, built by an agent, maintained by an agent, and evolving continuously based on how your team actually works?  The honest answer is: it depends. And what it depends on is the hardest problem in this entire stack, harder than intelligence, harder than coding, harder than pricing models.  It depends on whether an AI agent can take the vague, implicit, half-articulated thing a human actually wants and turn it into workable software.  This is the articulation problem, and it’s the real bottleneck — not for the SaaS companies, but for the “build your own” alternative. When a VP of sales says “I need a better way to track our pipeline,” that sentence contains about 5% of the information required to build a useful tool. The other 95% is buried in how the team actually works, what the unspoken conventions are, which exceptions matter and which don’t, how this quarter’s priorities differ from last quarter’s, what “better” means in context. A skilled product manager spends weeks extracting that information through interviews, observation, and iteration. Whether an AI agent can do the same thing — not just write the code, but understand the need deeply enough to write the right code — is an open question. I’m skeptical that we’re there yet. But agentic search is making progress on exactly this problem: agents that explore context, ask clarifying questions, observe usage patterns, and iteratively refine their understanding of what a human actually needs. It’s coming. The question is timing.  For the SaaS incumbents, this means the window is finite but not yet closed. Their data edge and their accountability edge buy them time. But only if they use that time to pivot to agentic-first rather than bolting AI onto the existing UI and hoping the storm passes.  For everyone else — every company that buys enterprise software — the question is simpler: when does “I could have an agent build this for me” become more attractive than “I’ll keep paying per-seat for the general-purpose version”? That threshold is going to cross at different times for different companies, different workflows, different levels of complexity. But the direction is clear, and the markdown file just made it impossible for anyone to pretend otherwise. **The SaaSpocalypse Isn’t Just a Market Story** I keep coming back to why this matters beyond stock charts.  The same dynamic that’s threatening enterprise SaaS companies — the difference between bolting AI on top of your existing approach and actually rethinking how you work from the ground up — applies to every individual knowledge worker reading this.  If you’re using ChatGPT to proofread emails you would have written anyway, you’re bolting AI on top. If you’re using Claude to summarize documents you would have read anyway, same thing. If you added a Copilot to your IDE but your development workflow is fundamentally the same as it was in 2024, you haven’t rebuilt anything — you’ve added a feature to a process that needs replacing. And just like the SaaS companies that are bolting AI features onto their existing products and hoping the market doesn’t notice, you’re decorating a structural problem rather than solving it.  The pace right now is almost incomprehensible. Opus 4.6 dropped and 5x’d the working memory of the most capable AI system on Earth in a single week. Codex shipped a desktop app. OpenAI launched Frontier, an enterprise agent platform. Claude Cowork went from “interesting demo” to “$285 billion market event” in 48 hours. If you ask an AI model right now to help you figure out how to use AI, you get advice that’s on average six months to a year out of date — the AI cannot keep up with itself.  This is hyper-acceleration. The word sounds like marketing until you’re living through it, and then it just sounds like Tuesday. The gap between “I use AI tools” and “I’ve actually rethought how I work around AI capabilities” is the individual version of the gap between “we added AI features to our SaaS product” and “we rebuilt our architecture to be agentic-first.” The first approach feels productive. The second approach is what actually changes outcomes. And the window to make the transition without falling catastrophically behind is narrowing every single week.  If you haven’t tried Opus 4.6 and experienced what a million-token context window actually means for how you process information — try it. If you haven’t used Claude Cowork or Codex or OpenAI Frontier and experienced what agentic workflows feel like when they work — try them. Not because any one tool is the answer, but because the experience of using these systems changes your mental model of what’s possible, and your mental model of what’s possible is the thing that determines whether you’re bolting on or rebuilding.  The SaaS companies that survive the SaaSpocalypse will be the ones that rethink their architecture before the market forces them to. The knowledge workers who thrive through this transition will be the ones who rethink their workflows before their employers force them to.  Same dynamic, same urgency — just at a different scale. **The Clock Is Running** The per-seat SaaS pricing model is broken. The data and accountability underneath it are not. The companies that figure out how to reprice their real assets for an agentic-first world will capture more value than they lost this week. The ones that bolt AI onto the existing UI and hope the market comes back are going to learn the same lesson print media learned: you can have the best content in the world and still lose everything if you can’t let go of the business model.  Your vendors know this. The KPMG playbook — “AI changes the economics, so let’s talk about your rates” — works at every scale. Your Salesforce rep, your legal research vendor, your document management provider — they’re all expecting the call. Make it.  The second-order repricing is coming. The market hit the obvious targets this week. It hasn’t hit the systems integrators, the training companies, the implementation consultants — the entire ecosystem that exists because humans needed help using one-size-fits-all software. When agents operate the software instead of humans, that ecosystem contracts. Nobody’s priced that in yet.  And the same logic applies to you. The SaaSpocalypse isn’t something that happened to software stocks. It’s a signal about the pace of change in every knowledge-work domain, including yours. What matters now is whether you’re rethinking your work around AI or just bolting it on top — and whether you’re doing it fast enough that you don’t end up like the companies that crashed this week, holding assets that are still valuable but trapped inside a model that no longer works.  A 200-line markdown file didn’t decide who wins and who loses. But it compressed a transition that everyone expected to take five years into a single-session repricing event, and the repricing hasn’t stopped. It’s barely started.  The clock started Monday. It isn’t stopping.  LINK to sources  I make this Substack thanks to readers like you!
