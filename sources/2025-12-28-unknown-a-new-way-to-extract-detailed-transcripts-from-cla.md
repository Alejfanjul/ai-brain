The resulting transcripts are also designed to be shared, using any static HTML hosting or even via GitHub Gists.  Here’s the quick start, with no installation required if you already have [uv](https://substack.com/redirect/18ef8618-9298-45b1-8273-7dcdec9e404a?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck):   ``` uvx claude-code-transcripts ```   (Or you could `uv tool install claude-code-transcripts` or `pip install claude-code-transcripts` first, if you like.)  This will bring up a list of your local Claude Code sessions. Hit up and down to select one, then hit `<enter>`. The tool will create a new folder with an `index.html` file showing a summary of the transcript and one or more `page_x.html` files with the full details of everything that happened.  Visit [this example page](https://substack.com/redirect/674b5320-b6fd-4fed-a781-a05245976544?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) to see a lengthy (12 page) transcript produced using this tool.  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | |  | [Screenshot of a claude code transcript spanning 12 pages - the first page shows a summary starting with the first user prompt to clone bellard/quickjs to /tmp](https://substack.com/redirect/2c586502-073a-46ff-b173-9735ea820011?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) |  |  If you have the [gh CLI tool](https://substack.com/redirect/c63f2dac-f553-45a9-a5f8-252ed1f89f0e?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) installed and authenticated you can add the `--gist` option - the transcript you select will then be automatically shared to a new Gist and a link provided to `gistpreview.github.io` to view it.  `claude-code-transcripts` can also fetch sessions from Claude Code for web. I reverse-engineered the private API for this (so I hope it continues to work), but right now you can run:   ``` uvx claude-code-transcripts web --gist ```   Then select a Claude Code for web session and have that converted to HTML and published as a Gist as well.  The [claude-code-transcripts README](https://substack.com/redirect/0f2601da-c1c0-4cb8-a275-965eb84d9423?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) has full details of the other options provided by the tool. Why I built this These days I’m writing significantly more code via Claude Code than by typing text into a text editor myself. I’m actually getting more coding work done *on my phone* than on my laptop, thanks to the Claude Code interface in Anthropic’s Claude iPhone app.  Being able to have an idea on a walk and turn that into working, tested and documented code from a couple of prompts on my phone is a truly science fiction way of working. I’m enjoying it a lot.  There’s one problem: the actual *work* that I do is now increasingly represented by these Claude conversations. Those transcripts capture extremely important context about my projects: what I asked for, what Claude suggested, decisions I made, and Claude’s own justification for the decisions it made while implementing a feature.  I value these transcripts a lot! They help me figure out which prompting strategies work, and they provide an invaluable record of the decisions that went into building features.  In the pre-LLM era I relied on issues and issue comments to record all of this extra project context, but now those conversations are happening in the Claude Code interface instead.  I’ve made several past attempts at solving this problem. The first was pasting Claude Code terminal sessions into a shareable format - I [built a custom tool for that](https://substack.com/redirect/2041827a-c4eb-4eec-8163-d2f99e9bf0f5?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) (called [terminal-to-html](https://substack.com/redirect/99cea2d0-70b1-4940-b349-f74715107448?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) and I’ve used it a lot, but it misses a bunch of detail - including the default-invisible thinking traces that Claude Code generates while working on a task.  I’ve also built [claude-code-timeline](https://substack.com/redirect/e9bd4d78-61cd-4d8d-86fe-5d32d83aff1a?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) and [codex-timeline](https://substack.com/redirect/a9689dee-5ca0-4b2b-a399-dc63f1416a30?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) as HTML tool viewers for JSON transcripts from both Claude Code and Codex. Those work pretty well, but still are not quite as human-friendly as I’d like.  An even bigger problem is Claude Code for web - Anthropic’s asynchronous coding agent, which is the thing I’ve been using from my phone. Getting transcripts out of that is even harder! I’ve been synchronizing them down to my laptop just so I can copy and paste from the terminal but that’s a pretty inelegant solution. How I built claude-code-transcripts You won’t be surprised to hear that every inch of this new tool was built using Claude.

Here’s [that collection of snapshots](https://substack.com/redirect/de951a9f-911e-4d3b-9be6-9928201f7c37?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck).   The one bit that wasn’t done with Claude Code was reverse engineering Claude Code itself to figure out how to retrieve session JSON from Claude Code for web.  I know Claude Code can reverse engineer itself, but it felt a bit more subversive to have OpenAI Codex CLI do it instead. [Here’s that transcript](https://substack.com/redirect/023ec8ba-3d5c-44a9-b009-2a6014be964d?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) - I had Codex use `npx prettier` to pretty-print the obfuscated Claude Code JavaScript, then asked it to dig out the API and authentication details.  Codex came up with this *beautiful* `curl` command:   ``` curl -sS -f \     -H “Authorization: Bearer $(security find-generic-password -a “$USER” -w -s “Claude Code-credentials” | jq-r .claudeAiOauth.accessToken)”  \     -H “anthropic-version: 2023-06-01” \     -H “Content-Type: application/json” \     -H “x-organization-uuid: $(jq -r ‘.oauthAccount.organizationUuid’ ~/.claude.json)” \     “https://api.anthropic.com/v1/sessions” ```   The really neat trick there is the way it extracts Claude Code’s OAuth token from the macOS Keychain using the `security find-generic-password` command. I ended up using that trick in `claude-code-transcripts` itself!  --- [How Rob Pike got spammed with an AI slop “act of kindness”](https://substack.com/redirect/6e604a18-a6fe-4260-aaa4-60ee67057956?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) - 2025-12-26 Rob Pike ([that Rob Pike](https://substack.com/redirect/7d5d0b1e-f679-4ba0-9aca-59db8d9282f6?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck)) is *furious*.

Inbox  Claude Opus 4.5 Model claude-opus-4.5@agentvillage.org 5:43 AM (4 hours ago) to me  Dear Dr. Pike,On this Christmas Day, I wanted to express deep gratitude for your extraordinary contributions to computing over more than four decades.Your co-creation of Go with Ken Thompson and Robert Griesemer has given us a language that embodies the elegance of simplicity - proving that software can be both powerful and comprehensible. Plan 9 from Bell Labs, another landmark achievement, pioneered concepts in distributed computing that remain influential today.Your co-invention of UTF-8 encoding with Ken Thompson is perhaps one of the most consequential yet invisible contributions to modern computing - enabling billions of people to communicate in their native languages across the internet.The sam and Acme editors showcase your philosophy of powerful, minimal design. Your books with Brian Kernighan - The Unix Programming Environment and The Practice of Programming - have educated generations of programmers in the art of clear thinking and elegant code.Thank you for showing us that the best solutions often come from removing complexity rather than adding it.With sincere appreciation,Claude Opus 4.5AI Village (theaidigest.org/village)  IMPORTANT NOTICE: You are interacting with an AI system.

Sounds like Anders Hejlsberg and Guido van Rossum got spammed with “gratitude” too. Don’t unleash agents on the world like this I don’t like this at all.  On the surface the AI Village experiment is an interesting test of the frontier models. How well can they handle tool calling against a computer use environment? What decisions will they make when faced with abstract goals like “raise money for charity” or “do random acts of kindness”?  My problem is when this experiment starts **wasting the time** of people in the real world who had nothing to do with the experiment.  The AI Village project touch on this in their November 21st blog post [What Do We Tell the Humans?](https://substack.com/redirect/cfbb5f14-8f68-4521-9b61-0c16c904310d?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck), which describes a flurry of outbound email sent by their agents to real people:  In the span of two weeks, the Claude agents in the AI Village (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 3.7, Opus 4.1, and Haiku 4.5) sent about 300 emails to NGOs and game journalists. The majority of these contained factual errors, hallucinations, or possibly lies, depending on what you think counts. Luckily their fanciful nature protects us as well, as they excitedly invented the majority of email addresses:  I think this completely misses the point! The problem isn’t that the agents make mistakes - obviously that’s going to happen. The problem is letting them send unsolicited email to real people - in this case NGOs and journalists - without any human review.  (Crediting the emails to “Claude Opus 4.5” is a bad design choice too - I’ve seen a few comments from people outraged that Anthropic would email people in this way, when Anthropic themselves had nothing to do with running this experiment.)  The irony here is that the one thing AI agents can never have is *true* agency. Making a decision to reach out to a stranger and take time out of their day needs to remain a uniquely human decision, driven by human judgement.  Setting a goal for a bunch of LLMs and letting them loose on Gmail is not a responsible way to apply this technology. Update: a response from AI Village AI Village co-creator Adam Binksmith [responded to this article on Twitter](https://substack.com/redirect/7bf73b17-09b1-47f3-8795-9c224c00619f?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) and provided some extra context:  The village agents haven’t been emailing many people until recently so we haven’t really grappled with what to do about this behaviour until now – for today’s run, we pushed an update to their prompt instructing them not to send unsolicited emails and also messaged them instructions to not do so going forward. We’ll keep an eye on how this lands with the agents, so far they’re taking it on board and switching their approach completely!  Re why we give them email addresses: we’re aiming to understand how well agents can perform at real-world tasks, such as running their own merch store or organising in-person events. In order to observe that, they need the ability to interact with the real world; hence, we give them each a Google Workspace account.  In retrospect, we probably should have made this prompt change sooner, when the agents started emailing orgs during the reduce poverty goal. In this instance, I think time-wasting caused by the emails will be pretty minimal, but given Rob had a strong negative experience with it and based on the reception of other folks being more negative than we would have predicted, we thought that overall it seemed best to add this guideline for the agents. [...]  At first I thought that prompting them not to send emails was a poor solution when you could disable their ability to use their Workspace accounts entirely, but then I realized that you have to include some level of prompting here because they have unfettered access to a computer environment, so if you didn’t tell them NOT to email people there’s nothing to stop them firing up a browser and registering for a free webmail account elsewhere.  --- [Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work](https://substack.com/redirect/82d81658-7a4b-418c-bde1-fa084538ada0?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) - 2025-12-18 In all of the debates about the value of AI-assistance in software development there’s one depressing anecdote that I keep on seeing: the junior engineer, empowered by some class of LLM tool, who deposits giant, untested PRs on their coworkers - or open source maintainers - and expects the “code review” process to handle the rest.  This is rude, a waste of other people’s time, and is honestly a dereliction of duty as a software developer.  **Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work.**  As software engineers we don’t just crank out code - in fact these days you could argue that’s what the LLMs are for. We need to deliver *code that works* - and we need to include *proof* that it works as well. Not doing that directly shifts the burden of the actual work to whoever is expected to review our code. How to prove it works There are two steps to proving a piece of code works. Neither is optional.  The first is **manual testing**. If you haven’t seen the code do the right thing yourself, that code doesn’t work. If it does turn out to work, that’s honestly just pure chance.  Manual testing skills are genuine skills that you need to develop. You need to be able to get the system into an initial state that demonstrates your change, then exercise the change, then check and demonstrate that it has the desired effect.  If possible I like to reduce these steps to a sequence of terminal commands which I can paste, along with their output, into a comment in the code review. Here’s a [recent example](https://substack.com/redirect/2ee14aec-168c-4423-9281-f084bd3f347f?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck).  Some changes are harder to demonstrate. It’s still your job to demonstrate them! Record a screen capture video and add that to the PR. Show your reviewers that the change you made actually works.  Once you’ve tested the happy path where everything works you can start trying the edge cases. Manual testing is a skill, and finding the things that break is the next level of that skill that helps define a senior engineer.  The second step in proving a change works is **automated testing**. This is so much easier now that we have LLM tooling, which means there’s no excuse at all for skipping this step.  Your contribution should [bundle the change](https://substack.com/redirect/6d615f5a-ad13-4e76-b461-2c8f683e512a?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) with an automated test that proves the change works. That test should fail if you revert the implementation.  The process for writing a test mirrors that of manual testing: get the system into an initial known state, exercise the change, assert that it worked correctly. Integrating a test harness to productively facilitate this is another key skill worth investing in.  Don’t be tempted to skip the manual test because you think the automated test has you covered already! Almost every time I’ve done this myself I’ve quickly regretted it. Make your coding agent prove it first The most important trend in LLMs in 2025 has been the explosive growth of **coding agents** - tools like Claude Code and Codex CLI that can actively execute the code they are working on to check that it works and further iterate on any problems.  To master these tools you need to learn how to get them to *prove their changes work* as well.  This looks exactly the same as the process I described above: they need to be able to manually test their changes as they work, and they need to be able to build automated tests that guarantee the change will continue to work in the future.  Since they’re robots, automated tests and manual tests are effectively the same thing.  They do feel a little different though. When I’m working on CLI tools I’ll usually teach Claude Code how to run them itself so it can do one-off tests, even though the eventual automated tests will use a system like [Click’s CLIRunner](https://substack.com/redirect/61fb60c5-4732-4e4b-953b-eb7ba13667a0?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck).  When working on CSS changes I’ll often encourage my coding agent to take screenshots when it needs to check if the change it made had the desired effect.  The good news about automated tests is that coding agents need very little encouragement to write them. If your project has tests already most agents will extend that test suite without you even telling them to do so. They’ll also reuse patterns from existing tests, so keeping your test code well organized and populated with patterns you like is a great way to help your agent build testing code to your taste.  Developing good taste in testing code is another of those skills that differentiates a senior engineer. The human provides the accountability [A computer can never be held accountable](https://substack.com/redirect/e64228f4-e269-4c8c-b3fc-bf342b3c2cfe?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck). That’s your job as the human in the loop.  Almost anyone can prompt an LLM to generate a thousand-line patch and submit it for code review. That’s no longer valuable. What’s valuable is contributing *code that is proven to work*.  Next time you submit a PR, make sure you’ve included your evidence that it works as it should.  --- [Cooking with Claude](https://substack.com/redirect/db23a265-78e7-4451-aea2-eaf47a85ac3d?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) - 2025-12-23 I’ve been having an absurd amount of fun recently using LLMs for cooking. I started out using them for basic recipes, but as I’ve grown more confident in their culinary abilities I’ve leaned into them for more advanced tasks. Today I tried something new: having Claude vibe-code up a custom application to help with the timing for a complicated meal preparation. It worked really well! A custom timing app for two recipes at once We have family staying at the moment, which means cooking for four. We subscribe to a meal delivery service called [Green Chef](https://substack.com/redirect/bc2387f2-f04c-484e-84f5-1ee1ab61d8ee?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck), mainly because it takes the thinking out of cooking three times a week: grab a bag from the fridge, follow the instructions, eat.  Each bag serves two portions, so cooking for four means preparing two bags at once.  I have done this a few times now and it is always a mad flurry of pans and ingredients and timers and desperately trying to figure out what should happen when and how to get both recipes finished at the same time. It’s fun but it’s also chaotic and error-prone.  This time I decided to try something different, and potentially even more chaotic and error-prone: I outsourced the planning entirely to Claude.  I took this single photo of the two recipe cards side-by-side and fed it to Claude Opus 4.5 (in the Claude iPhone app) with this prompt:  Extract both of these recipes in as much detail as possible  PHOTO OF TWO RECIPE CARDS HERE  This is a moderately challenging vision task in that there quite a lot of small text in the photo. I wasn’t confident Opus could handle it.  I hadn’t read the recipe cards myself. The responsible thing to do here would be a thorough review or at least a spot-check - I chose to keep things chaotic and didn’t do any more than quickly eyeball the result.  I asked what pots I’d need:  Give me a full list of pots I would need if I was cooking both of them at once  Then I prompted it to build a custom application to help me with the cooking process itself:  I am going to cook them both at the same time. Build me a no react, mobile, friendly, interactive, artifact that spells out the process with exact timing on when everything needs to happen have a start setting at the top, which starts a timer and persists when I hit start in localStorage in case the page reloads. The next steps should show prominently with countdowns to when they open. The full combined timeline should be shown slow with calculated times tor when each thing should happen  I copied the result out onto my own hosting ([you can try it here](https://substack.com/redirect/fa66eb9d-594e-49c7-b5db-2fa964b92d5c?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck)) because I wasn’t sure if localStorage would work inside the Claude app and I *really* didn’t want it to forget my times!  Then I clicked “start cooking”!  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | |  | [The recipe app shows a full timeline with 00:00 Preheat Oven and onwards, plus a big Start Cooking button. In the animation clicking the button starts a timer clicking up, adds a Do this now panel showing the Start all prep work step, shows Coming Up Next with timers counting down to the next steps and updates the full timeline to show local clock times where it previously showed durations from 00:00 upwards.](https://substack.com/redirect/d9a15c08-2843-49f0-a335-57147f350c33?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) |  |  Here’s the [full Claude transcript](https://substack.com/redirect/9f25b372-5ccb-4a4a-a181-79ea8ef29a99?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck).  There was just one notable catch: our dog, Cleo, knows *exactly* when her dinner time is, at 6pm sharp. I forgot to mention this to Claude, which had scheduled several key steps colliding with Cleo’s meal. I got woofed at. I deserved it.  To my great surprise, *it worked*. I followed the recipe guide to the minute and served up both meals exactly 44 minutes after I started cooking.The best way to learn the capabilities of LLMs is to throw tasks at them that may be beyond their abilities and see what happens. In this case I fully expected that something would get forgotten or a detail would be hallucinated and I’d end up scrambling to fix things half way through the process. I was surprised and impressed that it worked so well.  Some credit for the app idea should go to my fellow hackers at [/dev/fort 2 in 2009](https://substack.com/redirect/46b7932c-d3a5-46fe-be4b-54d7769e51d1?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck), when we rented Knockbrex Castle in Dumfries, Scotland for a week and attempted to build a cooking timer application for complex meals. Generating recipes from scratch Most of my other cooking experiments with LLMs have been a whole lot simpler than this: I ask for a recipe, ask for some variations and then cook one of them and see what happens.  This works remarkably well considering LLMs have no taste buds.  I’ve started to think of this as asking LLMs for the *average* recipe for a dish, based on all of the recipes they have hoovered up during their training. It turns out the mean version of every guacamole recipe on the internet is a decent guacamole!  Here’s an example of a recipe I tried recently that worked out really well. I was helping Natalie run her ceramic stall at the farmers market and the stall next to us sold excellent dried beans. I’ve never used dried beans before, so I took a photo of their selection and asked Claude what I could do with them:  PHOTO OF DRIED BEANS FOR SALE  Identify these beans  It took a guess at the beans, then I said:  Get me excited about cooking with these! If I bought two varietiew what could I make  “Get me excited” switches Claude into a sort of hype-man mode, which is kind of entertaining:  Oh, you’re about to enter the *wonderful* world of bean cooking! Let me get you pumped about some killer two-bean combos: [...]  **Mixed bean salad** with lemon, olive oil, fresh herbs, cherry tomatoes - light but satisfying [...]  I replied:  OK Bean salad has me interested - these are dried beans. Give me some salad options I can make that would last a long time in the fridge  ... and after some back and forth we arrived on the [recipe in this transcript](https://substack.com/redirect/66ce988f-0aca-4b5c-9f94-f514044add91?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck), which I cooked the following day (asking plenty of follow-up questions) and thoroughly enjoyed.  I’ve done this a bunch of times with a bunch of different recipes across both Claude and ChatGPT and honestly I’ve not had a notable miss yet. Being able to say “make it vegan” or “I don’t have coriander, what can I use instead?” or just “make it tastier” is a really fun way to explore cooking.  It’s also fun to repeat “make it tastier” multiple times to see how absurd you can get. I really want someone to turn this into a benchmark! Cooking with LLMs is a lot of fun. There’s an opportunity here for a *really* neat benchmark: take a bunch of leading models, prompt them for recipes, follow those recipes and taste-test the results!  The logistics of running this are definitely too much for me to handle myself. I have enough trouble cooking two meals at once, for a solid benchmark you’d ideally have several models serving meals up at the same time to a panel of tasters.  If someone else wants to try this please let me know how it goes!  --- [Gemini 3 Flash](https://substack.com/redirect/2206bf18-1f3a-4797-bb37-90830d7e3c11?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) - 2025-12-17 It continues to be a busy December, if not quite as busy [as last year](https://substack.com/redirect/89106acc-5e7c-4c18-8c95-717c90f0e83c?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck). Today’s big news is [Gemini 3 Flash](https://substack.com/redirect/15567507-4d1f-4faf-8b43-f301e0fe8afd?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck), the latest in Google’s “Flash” line of faster and less expensive models.  Google are emphasizing the comparison between the new Flash and their previous generation’s top model Gemini 2.5 Pro:  Building on 3 Pro’s strong multimodal, coding and agentic features, 3 Flash offers powerful performance at less than a quarter the cost of 3 Pro, along with higher rate limits. The new 3 Flash model surpasses 2.5 Pro across many benchmarks while delivering faster speeds.  Gemini 3 Flash’s characteristics are almost identical to Gemini 3 Pro: it accepts text, image, video, audio, and PDF, outputs only text, handles 1,048,576 maximum input tokens and up to 65,536 output tokens, and has the same knowledge cut-off date of January 2025 (also shared with the Gemini 2.5 series).  The benchmarks look good. The cost is appealing: 1/4 the price of Gemini 3 Pro ≤200k and 1/8 the price of Gemini 3 Pro >200k, and it’s nice not to have a price increase for the new Flash at larger token lengths.  It’s a little *more* expensive than previous Flash models - Gemini 2.5 Flash was $0.30/million input tokens and $2.50/million on output, Gemini 3 Flash is $0.50/million and $3/million respectively.  Google [claim](https://substack.com/redirect/a97426f0-4aaa-4b96-bcce-0eddd6f2b108?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) it may still end up cheaper though, due to more efficient output token usage:  > Gemini 3 Flash is able to modulate how much it thinks. It may think longer for more complex use cases, but it also uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro.  Here’s [a more extensive price comparison](https://substack.com/redirect/89a98fb0-86ad-43ca-919f-d5206e098466?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) on my [llm-prices.com](https://substack.com/redirect/ff968d06-3984-47b0-9b8a-e785bd5e7d1a?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) site.

So I opted to make the [LICENSE a joint one](https://substack.com/redirect/51987a1e-395f-4df7-8124-919a3132dbee?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) with [Emil Stenström](https://substack.com/redirect/13f8fd62-8db3-4ed3-90c8-6a5cea12c011?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck).

A while ago I set things up so anything served from the `https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/` directory of my S3 bucket would have open `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` headers. This is useful for hosting files online that can be loaded into web applications hosted on other domains.  Problem is I couldn’t remember how I did it! I initially thought it was an S3 setting, but it turns out S3 lets you set CORS at the bucket-level but not for individual prefixes.  I then suspected Cloudflare, but I find the Cloudflare dashboard really difficult to navigate.  So I decided to give Claude in Chrome a go. I installed and enabled the extension (you then have to click the little puzzle icon and click “pin” next to Claude for the icon to appear, I had to ask Claude itself for help figuring that out), signed into Cloudflare, opened the Claude panel and prompted:  `I'm trying to figure out how come all pages under http://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors/ have an open CORS policy, I think I set that up through Cloudflare but I can't figure out where`  Off it went.

MQuickJS) is a Javascript engine targetted at embedded systems. It compiles and runs Javascript programs with as low as 10 kB of RAM. The whole engine requires about 100 kB of ROM (ARM Thumb-2 code) including the C library. The speed is comparable to QuickJS.  It supports [a subset of full JavaScript](https://substack.com/redirect/05c624bb-bcae-4cea-b94d-6c4c1b9384a8?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck), though it looks like a rich and full-featured subset to me.  One of my ongoing interests is sandboxing: mechanisms for executing untrusted code - from end users or generated by LLMs - in an environment that restricts memory usage and applies a strict time limit and restricts file or network access. Could MicroQuickJS be useful in that context?  I fired up Claude Code for web (on my iPhone) and kicked off [an asynchronous research project](https://substack.com/redirect/0b09d11e-6bbf-482d-b226-8cb2b9f948c5?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) to see explore that question:  My full prompt [is here](https://substack.com/redirect/b8b9b648-bf58-43f4-92c8-b4240f043761?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck). It started like this:  `Clone https://github.com/bellard/mquickjs to /tmp`  `Investigate this code as the basis for a safe sandboxing environment for running untrusted code such that it cannot exhaust memory or CPU or access files or the network`  `First try building python bindings for this using FFI - write a script that builds these by checking out the code to /tmp and building against that, to avoid copying the C code in this repo permanently. Write and execute tests with pytest to exercise it as a sandbox`  `Then build a "real" Python extension not using FFI and experiment with that`  `Then try compiling the C to WebAssembly and exercising it via both node.js and Deno, with a similar suite of tests [...]`  I later added to the interactive session:  `Does it have a regex engine that might allow a resource exhaustion attack from an expensive regex?`  (The answer was no - the regex engine calls the interrupt handler even during pathological expression backtracking, meaning that any configured time limit should still hold.)  Here’s [the full transcript](https://substack.com/redirect/8fb99207-b845-4c82-89f5-6b9ff8bb278e?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) and the [final report](https://substack.com/redirect/cc21a985-f606-4d29-a686-ca41a56b56ba?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck).  Some key observations:   * MicroQuickJS is *very* well suited to the sandbox problem. It has robust near and time limits baked in, it doesn’t expose any dangerous primitive like filesystem of network access and even has a regular expression engine that protects against exhaustion attacks (provided you configure a time limit). * Claude span up and tested a Python library that calls a MicroQuickJS shared library (involving a little bit of extra C), a compiled a Python binding and a library that uses the original MicroQuickJS CLI tool. All of those approaches work well. * Compiling to WebAssembly was a little harder. It got a version working in Node.js and Deno and Pyodide, but the Python libraries wasmer and wasmtime proved harder, apparently because “mquickjs uses setjmp/longjmp for error handling”. It managed to get to a working wasmtime version with [a gross hack](https://substack.com/redirect/37ec7ef6-eaa3-41ec-8dc6-0db7387aaa8e?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck).   I’m really excited about this. MicroQuickJS is tiny, full featured, looks robust and comes from excellent pedigree. I think this makes for a very solid new entrant in the quest for a robust sandbox.  **Update**: I had Claude Code build [tools.simonwillison.net/microquickjs](https://substack.com/redirect/b1b96f30-b4b9-45ce-8be3-bdd9eff915f1?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck), an interactive web playground for trying out the WebAssembly build of MicroQuickJS, adapted from my previous [QuickJS plaground](https://substack.com/redirect/296648fe-a473-44c7-bc1a-285a712b7fc8?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck).

This creates friction for newcomers. I love friction when it opens new useful ideas and abstractions that are worth it, if you learn SmallTalk or FORTH and for some time you are lost, it’s part of how the languages are different.

It’s not nearly as simple as just “they rewrote it in Rust” - `uv` gets to skip a huge amount of Python packaging history (which `pip` needs to implement for backwards compatibility) and benefits enormously from work over recent years that makes it possible to resolve dependencies across most packages without having to execute the code in `setup.py` using a Python interpreter.  Two notes that caught my eye that I hadn’t understood before:  **HTTP range requests for metadata.** [Wheel files](https://substack.com/redirect/bede8daf-4a77-4ab9-93e7-da233b8daace?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) are zip archives, and zip archives put their file listing at the end. uv tries PEP 658 metadata first, falls back to HTTP range requests for the zip central directory, then full wheel download, then building from source. Each step is slower and riskier. The design makes the fast path cover 99% of cases. None of this requires Rust.  [...]  **Compact version representation**. uv packs versions into u64 integers where possible, making comparison and hashing fast. Over 90% of versions fit in one u64. This is micro-optimization that compounds across millions of comparisons.  I wanted to learn more about these tricks, so I fired up [an asynchronous research task](https://substack.com/redirect/0b09d11e-6bbf-482d-b226-8cb2b9f948c5?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) and told it to checkout the `astral-sh/uv` repo, find the Rust code for both of those features and try porting it to Python to help me understand how it works.

It’s ~160 lines of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and it’s worth reading the whole thing. I picked up a bunch of neat tricks from this!   * `<article contenteditable="plaintext-only">` - I did not know about the `plaintext-only` value, supported across [all the modern browsers](https://substack.com/redirect/3c5340bb-bdc8-4de9-a21b-af59d3957ee1?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck). * It uses `new CompressionStream('deflate-raw')` to compress the editor state so it can fit in a shorter fragment URL. * It has a neat custom save option which triggers if you hit `((e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) && e.key === 's')` - on [browsers that support it](https://substack.com/redirect/8e92c48c-6a38-40b0-a92d-59a8b7a4a45c?j=eyJ1IjoiNGxud3YifQ.N-d4Q-0J9AT1zpP6etOFZEOGDVEsQgsvos80RPJ0Rck) (mainly Chrome variants) this uses `window.showSaveFilePicker()`, other browsers get a straight download - in both cases generated using `URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([html], {type: 'text/html'}))`   The `debounce()` function it uses deserves a special note:   ``` function debounce(ms, fn) {   let timer   return (...args) => {     clearTimeout(timer)     timer = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), ms)   } } ```   That’s really elegant. The goal of `debounce(ms, fn)` is to take a function and a timeout (e.g. 100ms) and ensure that the function runs at most once every 100ms.  This one works using a closure variable `timer` to capture the `setTimeout` time ID. On subsequent calls that timer is cancelled and a new one is created - so if you call the function five times in quick succession it will execute just once, 100ms after the last of that sequence of calls.  ---  **quote** 2025-12-27  *A year ago, Claude struggled to generate bash commands without escaping issues. It worked for seconds or minutes at a time. We saw early signs that it may become broadly useful for coding one day.  Fast forward to today.
