Kind: captions Language: en - We're now seeing billion dollar companies built with 30 people or less at a rapid clip. And two years ago, we wrote an article called The Three Person Unicorn, which we predicted this would happen. And sure enough, two years later, here we are, we got companies like Cursor talking about a $100M in ARR, which is 30 people companies like Eleven Labs doing about $90M of ARR with 50 people. You've got companies like Mercor, doing about $50M with like 30 people. And then you've got companies like Lovable, which in just two months, with 15 people has gone to $10M of ARR. So we're seeing this, and it's not the future, it's happening now. The numbers are in. We see what's happening with these small companies growing incredibly quickly, and it's happening much more often than we saw 10 years ago when we had maybe Instagram and WhatsApp and Groupon. Some very narrow types of businesses could grow at this speed, but now lots of different types of companies are gonna grow at this speed. So these are teams that can fit in a conference room. So if you're a founder, we're gonna tell you how to do it. So the first thing to wrap your head around is that what you really need is people who are good at setting up systems. You set up AI agents and systems for your sales, for your marketing, for your customer service, for your HR, for your legal can all be done today. So you set these systems up and they're like spinning plates. You just gotta get them spinning and then you go back and check on them periodically to make sure they don't fall and break, right? So the old rules of team size and how much you can accomplish are gone. And so this is the reason why the need for the number of people really shrinks. So the big aha is something called allometric scaling. It's a biological term, but it's really cool. It means that if something gets heavier, it needs to get heavier still to support the weight. And so the same is true in the other direction. If something gets lighter, if you have fewer people in your company, then the systems you need to support, the lighter weight of the company gets lighter. So it can get smaller and smaller. And so if you use Allometric scaling in building your company small and fast and tight, it can get even smaller and even tighter and even faster. So having fewer people means less drama, less politics, less salaries, less dilution. And you only have to bring on people onto your team that are the a plus people that you want. You don't have to sort of fill it in with whoever you can get. If you're gonna have fewer people, then every business operation gets easier and faster and cheaper. But you can't just throw three people in a room. These people actually need to be able to run AI systems, wear multiple hats, and perform at a very high level. And we've seen three types. The first type you need is the visionary founder, like a Steve Jobs, who can see the opportunity before others do, and who's really the driving the product person, who's the product visionary. The second person you need is the numbers person. The person who thinks in numbers, thinks in metrics, loves spreadsheets, they run the finance, they run the ops, and they love details and they won't let get decisions made without data. Just like the Mentat from Dune, everyone looks to him when they've got a question and he's always got the answer. The third person you need is the words person. The Don Draper, if you will, the person who can take the AI input and turn it into human messaging. The one who gives you that feel, that taste, that that that brand that's gonna be totally necessary in such a competitive world. Now, not everybody needs to do everything, but they need to each be able to run AI systems to keep those plates spinning, vision numbers and words. And that's what we mean by the three person unicorn. So what AI can't do is it can't have these flashes of insight. This is the founder advantage. Maybe 90% of your company is gonna be AI agents, but 10% of it won't be. And that's where the founders come in. And that's why founders are still the most important piece of this. On most days, AI will outperform most people, but there are those moments when we need insight, when we need a change of direction, when we need a change of opinion, we need a change of feel that only the founders can provide. The key is acting in those moments, and that's the founder's edge. And the key to that is to get outta your own way, you have to unlearn what you've learned in the past so that it becomes a connection between you and your few founders and your few employees with the ai. And that's how we're gonna build very small, very fast growing, very big companies going forward. So two years ago we predicted there would be three person unicorns, and already we're seeing 15, 10, 30 person companies getting close or past that mark. And what we think is gonna happen next, the new prediction is that we're gonna have hyper-unicorns, unicorns which become unicorns in just six months after launching. So if you're a founder and you think you've got a chance and a way of getting at that, we'd love to talk to you. You know, this isn't just about startups having an edge. It bleeds into everything. It bleeds into content. For instance, this script that I'm saying written by ai, this video you're watching edited by ai, the only real thing in this piece of content is me in this room and the camera in front of me. Or am I avatar? Hard to say.
