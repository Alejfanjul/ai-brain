What happens a year from now, when most of those ten hours have been transformed by AI? We probably won’t remember what it was like today.    • [Email to a friend](https://app.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?Fwd2FriendEdit=1081591;76285107;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/939534224/0/sethsblog/posts~time-machine/;1981 time machine;26380180) • | |  |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | You're getting this note because you subscribed to Seth Godin's blog.
